接弟信，具悉一切。弟谓命运作主，余所深信，谓自强者，每胜一筹，则余不甚深信。凡国之强，必须多得贤臣；凡家之强，必须多出贤子弟，此亦关乎天命，不尽由于人谋。至一身之强，则不外乎北宫黝、孟施舍、曾子三种，孟子之集议而慊，即曾子之自反而缩也。\n\n    惟曾子与孔子告仲田之强，略为可久可常，此外斗智斗力之强，则有因强而大兴，亦有因强而大败。古来如李斯曹操董卓杨素，其智力皆横绝一世，而其祸败亦迥异寻常，近世如陆何萧陈皆予知自雄，而俱不保其终；故吾辈在自修处求强则可，在胜人处求强则不可。若专在胜人处求强，其能强到底与否，尚未可知，即使终身强横安稳，亦君子所不屑道也。\n\n

吾九年以来，痛戒无恒之弊，看书写字，从未间断，选将练兵，亦常留心，此皆自强能立工夫。奏疏公牍，再三斟酌，无一过当之语，自夸之辞，此皆圆融能达工夫。至于怨天本有所不敢，尤人则尚不能免，亦皆随时强制而克去之。\n\n

沅甫九弟左右：\n\n    十二日正七、有十归，接弟信，备悉一切。定湘营既至三曲滩，其营官成章鉴亦武弁中之不可多得者，弟可与之款接。来书谓“意趣不在此，则兴会索然”，此却大不可。凡人作一事，便须全副精神往在此一事，首尾不懈。不可见异思迁，做这样想那样，坐这山望那山。人而无恒，终身一无所成，我生平坐犯无恒的弊病，实在受害不校当翰林时，应留心诗字，则好涉猎他书，以纷其志；读性理书时，则杂以诗文各集，以歧其趋。在六部时，又不甚实力讲求公事。在外带兵，又不能竭力专治军事，或读书写字以乱其志意。坐是垂老而百无一成，即水军一事，亦掘井九仞而不及泉弟当以为鉴戒。\n\n    现在带勇，即埋头尽力以求带勇之法，早夜孽孽，日所思，夜所梦，舍带勇以外则一概不管。不可又想读书，又想中举，又想作州县，纷纷扰扰，干头万绪，将来又蹈我之覆辙，百无一成，悔之晚矣。\n\n    带勇之法，以体察人才为第一，整顿营规、讲求战守次之，《得胜歌》中各条，一一皆宜详求。至于口粮一事，不宜过于忧虑，不可时常发禀。弟章既得楚局每月六千，又得江局月二三千，便是极好境遇。李希庵十二来家，言迪庵意欲帮弟饷万金。又余有浙盐赢馀万五千两在江省，昨盐局专丁前来禀沟，余嘱其解交藩库充饷，将来此款或可酌解弟营，但弟不宜指请耳。\n\n    饷项既不劳心，全剧精神讲求前者数事，行有馀力则联络各营，款接绅士。身体虽弱，却不宜过于爱惜。精神愈用则愈出，阳气愈提则愈盛。每日作事愈多，则夜间临睡愈快活。若存一爱惜精神的意思，将前将却，奄奄无气，决难成事。——凡此，皆因弟兴会索然之言而切戒之者也。\n\n    弟宜以李迪庵为法，不慌不忙，盈科后进，到八九个月后，必有一番回甘滋味出来。余生平坐无恒流弊极大，今老矣，不能不教诫吾弟吾子。\n\n    邓先生品学极好，甲三八股文有长进，亦山先生亦请邓改文。亦山教书严肃，学生甚为畏惮。吾家戏言戏动积习，明年喜在家，当与两先生尽改之。\n\n    下游镇江、瓜洲同日克夏，金陵指日可克。厚庵放闽中提督，已赴金陵会剿，准其专招奏事。九江亦即日可复。大约军事在吉安、抚、建等府结局，贤弟勉之。\n\n    吾为其始，弟善其终，实有厚望。若稍参以客气，将以鼓志，则不能为我增气也。\n\n    营中哨队请人气尚完固否？下次祈书及。（咸丰七年十二月十四日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅甫九弟左右：\n\n    初三日刘福一等归，接来信，藉悉一切。城贼围困已久，\n######################\nOutput:"

 吾每作书与诸弟，不觉其言之长，想诸弟或厌烦难看矣。然诸弟苟有长信与我，我实乐之，如获至宝，人固各有性情也。\n\n    余自十月初一起记日课，念念欲改过自新；思从前与小珊有隙，实是一朝之忿，不近人情，即欲登门谢罪。恰好初九日小珊来拜寿，是夜余即至小珊家久谈。十三日与岱云合队，请小珊吃饭，从此欢笑如初，前隙盖释矣。近事大略如此，容再读书。国藩手具。（道光二十二年十月二十六日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n    父母亲大人万福金安。六月廿日，接六弟五月十二书，七月十六，接四弟九弟五月廿九日书。皆言忙迫之至，寥寥数语、字迹潦草，即县试案首前列，皆不写出。同乡有同日接信者，即考古老先生，皆已详载。同一折差也，各家发信，迟十余日而从容；诸弟发信，早十余日而忙迫，何也？且次次忙迫，无一次从容者，又何也？\n\n    男等在京，大小平安，同乡诸家皆好；惟汤海秋于七月八日得病，初九日未刻即逝。八月十八考教习，冯树堂、郭筠仙、朱啸山皆龋湖南今年考差，仅何子贞得差，余皆未放，惟陈岱云光景最苦。男因去年之病，反以不放为乐。王仕四已善为遣回，率五大约在粮船回，现尚未定；渠身体平安，二妹不必挂心。叔父之病，男累求详信直告，至今未得，实不放心。\n\n    甲三读《尔雅》，每日二十余字，颇肯率教。六弟今年正月信，欲从罗维山处附来，男甚喜之！后来信绝不提及，不知何故？所付来京之文，殊不甚好。在省读书二年，不见长进，男心实忧之，而无如何，只恨男不善教诲而已。大抵第一要除骄傲气习，中无所有，而夜郎自大，此最坏事。四弟九弟虽不长进，亦不自满，求大人教六弟，总期不自满足为要。余俟续陈。男谨禀。（道光二十四年七月廿日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n

吾人只有进德、修业两事靠得祝进德，则孝弟仁义是也；修业，则诗文作字是也。此二者由我作主，得尺则我之尺也，得寸则我之寸也。今日进一分德，便算积了一升谷；明日修一分业，又算馀了一文钱；德业并增，则家私日起。至于功名富贵，悉由命走，丝毫不能自主。昔某官有一门生为本省学政，托以两孙，当面拜为门生。后其两孙岁考临场大病，科考丁艰，竟不入学。数年后两孙乃皆入，其长者仍得两榜。此可见早迟之际，时刻皆有前走，尽其在我，听其在天，万不可稍生妄想。六弟天分较话弟更高，今年受黜，未免愤怨，然及此正可困心横虑，大加卧薪尝胆之功，切不可因愤废学。\n######################\nOutput:"

王衡臣于闰月初九引见，以知县用，后于月底搬寓下洼一庙中，竟于九月初二夜无故遽卒。先夕与同寓文任吾谈至二更，次早饭时，讶其不起，开门视之，则已死矣。死生之理，善人之报，竟不可解。\n\n    邑中劝捐，弥补亏空之事，余前己有信言之。万不可勉强勒派。我县之亏，亏于官者半，亏于书吏者半，而民则无辜也。向来书吏之中饱，上则吃官，下则吃民，名为包片包解。其实当征之时，是以百姓为鱼肉而吞噬之，当解之时，则以官为雉媒而播弄之。官索钱粮于书吏之手，犹索食于虎狼之口，再四求之，而终不肯吐，所以积成巨亏。并非实欠在民，亦非官之侵蚀人已也。今年父亲大人议定粮饷之事，一破从前包征包解之陋风，实为官民两利，所不利者，仅书吏耳。即见制台留朱公，亦造福一邑不小，诸弟皆宜\n######################\nOutput:"

九弟劝我治家之法，甚有道理，喜甚慰甚！自荆七遗去之后，家中亦甚整齐，待率五归家便知。书曰：“非知之艰，行之维艰。”九弟所言之理，亦我所深知者，但不能庄严威厉，使人望若神明耳。自此后当以九弟言书诸绅，而刻刻警剩季弟天性笃厚，诚如四弟所云，乐何如之！求我示读书之法，及进德之道。另纸开示。作不具，国藩手草。（道光二十四年八月付九日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n

余平生科名极为顺遂，惟小考七次始售。然每次不进，未尝敢出一怨言，但深愧自己试场之诗文太丑而已。至今思之，如芒在背。当时之不敢怨言，诸弟问父亲、叔父及朱尧阶便知。盖场屋之中，只有文五而侥幸者，断无文佳而埋没者，此一定之理也。\n\n    三房十四叔非不勤读，只为傲气太胜，自满自足，遂不能有所成。京城之中，亦多有自满之人，识者见之，发一冷笑而已。又有当名士者，鄙科名为粪土，或好作诗古文，或好讲考据，或好谈理学，嚣嚣然自以为压倒一切矣。自识者观之，彼其所造曾无几何，亦足发一冷笑而已。故吾人用功，力除傲气，力戒自满，毋为人所冷笑，乃有进步也。诸弟平日皆恂恂退让，第累年小试不售，恐因愤激之久，致生骄惰之气，故特作书戒之。务望细思吾言而深省焉，幸甚幸甚！国藩手草。（道光二十四年十月廿一日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n

男近来身体不甚结实，稍一一用心，即癣发于面。医者皆言心亏血热，故不能养肝，热极生风，阳气上肝，故见于头面。男恐大发，则不能入见，故不敢用心，谨守大人保养身体之训，隔一日至衙门办公事，余则在家不妄出门。现在衙门诸事，男俱已熟悉，各司官于男皆甚佩服，上下水乳俱融，同寅亦极协和。男虽终身在礼部衙门，为国家办照例之事，不苟不懈，尽就条理，亦所深愿也。\n\n

朱子尝言：“悔字如春，万物蕴蓄初发。吉字如夏，万物茂盛已极。吝字如秋，万物如落。凶字如冬，万物初调。”又尝以元字配春，享字配夏，利字配秋，贞字配冬，兄意贞字即硬字诀也。弟当此艰危之际，若能以硬字法冬藏之德，以悔字启春生之机，庶几可挽回一二乎？\n\n    闻左帅近日亦极谦慎，在汉口气象何如？弟曾闻其大略否？申甫阅历极深，若遇危难之际，与之深谈，渠尚能于恶风骇浪之中，默识把舵之道，在司道中，不可多得也。（同治六年三月初二日）\n\n------------\n\n\n\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n

孙男身体甚好，每日佻达欢呼，曾无歇息，孙女亦好。浙江之事，闻于正月底交战，仍尔不胜。去岁所失宁波府城，定海、镇海二县城，尚未收复。英夷滋扰以来，皆汉好助之为卢，此辈食毛践土，丧尽天良，不知何日罪恶贯盈，始得聚而歼灭。\n\n

今人都将学字看错了，若细读贤贤易色一章，则绝大学问，即在家庭日用之间：于孝悌两字上，尽一分，便是一分学，尽十分，便是十分学，今人读书皆为科名起见，于孝悌耸纪之大，反似与书不相关。殊不知书上所载的，作工时所代圣贤的，无非要明白这个道理。若果事事做得，即笔下说不出何妨；若事事不能做，并有亏于伦纪之大，即文章说得好，亦只算个名教中之罪人。\n\n    贤弟性情真挚，而短于诗文，何不日日在孝悌两字上用功？《曲礼》内则所说的，句句依他做出，务使祖父母父母叔父母无一时不安乐，无一时不用适；下而兄弟妻子，皆蔼然有恩，秩然有序，此真大学问也！若诗文不好，此时事不足计，即好极亦不值一钱，不知贤弟肯则听此语否？科名之气以可贵者，诈其足以承堂上之欢也，也谓禄仕可以养亲也。今吾已得之矣，即使诸弟不得。亦可以承欢，亦可以养亲，何必兄弟尽得哉？贤弟若细思此理，但于孝梯上用功，不于诗文上用功，则诗文不期进而自进矣。\n\n    凡作字总须得势，使一笔可以走千里。三弟之字，笔笔无势，是以局促不能远纵，去年曾与九弟说及，想近来已忘之矣。九弟欲看余白折，余所写折子甚少，故不付。\n\n    地仙为人主葬，害人一家，丧良心不少，未有不家败人亡者，不可不力阻凌云也。至于纺棉之说，中直隶之三河县灵寿县，无论贫富男妇，人人纺布为生，如我境之耕田为生也。江甫之妇人耕田，独三河之男人纺布也。湖南如浏阳之夏布，祁阳之葛布，宜昌之棉花，皆无论贫富男妇人，皆依以为业，并此不足为骇异也。第风俗难以这变，必至骇人听闻，不如删去一段为妙！书不尽言。国藩手草。（道光二十三年六月初六日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    四位老弟左右：\n\n    二月初十日，黄仙垣来京，接到家信，备悉一切，欣慰之至。\n\n    朱啸山亦于是日到，现与家心斋同居。伊兄代伊觅得房子，距余寓甚近，不过一箭远耳。郭筠仙现尚未到，余已为凭本胡同关帝庙房，使渠在庙中住，在余家伙食。\n\n    冯树堂正月初六日来余家，抉会试后再行上学，因小儿春间怕冷故也。树堂于二月十三日考国子监学正，题而耻恶衣恶食者二句，不以天下奉一人策，共五百人入场，树堂写作俱佳，应可以得。\n\n    陈岱云于初六日移寓报国寺，其配之枢，亦停寺中。岱云哀伤异常，不可劝止，作祭文一篇三千余字，余为作墓志铭一首，不知陈宅已寄归否？余懒腾寄也。\n\n    四川门生，现已到廿余人，我县会试者，大约可十五人，甲午同年，大约可念五六人。然有求于者，颇不乏人。\n\n    余今年应酬更繁，幸身体大好，迥不似从前光景，面胖而润，较前稍白矣。\n\n    耳鸣亦好十之七八，尚有微根未断，不过月余可全好也。内人及儿子两女皆好，陈氏小儿在余家乳养者亦好。\n\n

温甫六弟左右：\n\n    五月廿九，六月初一，连接弟三月初一，四月廿五，五月初一，三次所发之信，并四书文二茸，笔力实实可爱！信中有云：“于兄弟出直达其隐，父子祖孙间，不得不曲致其情。”此数语有大道理。余之行事，每自以为至诚可质天地，何妨直情径行。昨接四弟信，始知家人天亲之地，亦有时须委曲以行之者、吾过矣！吾过矣！\n\n

   衡阳风俗，只有冬学要紧，自五月以后，师弟皆奉行故事而已。同学之人，类皆庸鄙无志者，又最好讪笑人，其笑法不一，总之不离乎轻薄而已。四弟若到衡阳去，必以翰林之弟相笑，薄俗可恶。乡问无朋友，实是第一恨事，不惟无益，且大有损，习俗染人，所谓与鲍鱼处，亦与之俱化也。兄常与九弟道及，谓衡阳不可以读书，涟演不可以读书，为损友大多故也。\n\n    今四弟意必从觉庵师游，则千万听兄嘱咐，但取明师之益，无受损友之损也。\n\n    接到此信，立即率厚二到觉庵师处受业。其束修今年谨具钱十挂，兄于八月准付回，不至累及家中，非不欲人丰，实不能耳。兄所最虑者，同学之人，无志嘻游，端节以后，放散不事事，恐弟与厚二效尤耳，切戒切戒！凡从师必久而后可以获益，四弟与季弟，今年从觉庵师，若地方相安，则明年仍可以游，若一年换一处，是即无恒者见异思迁也，欲求长进难矣。\n\n    六弟之信，乃一篇绝妙古文，排百似昌黎，拗很似半山，予论古文，总须有倔强不驯之气，愈拗愈深之意，故于太史公外，独取昌黎半山两家。论诗亦取傲兀不群者，论字亦然，每蓄此意而不轻谈。近得何子贞，意见极相合，偶谈一二句，两人相视而笑。不知六弟乃生成有此一技妙笔，往时见弟文亦无大奇特者，今观此信，然后知吾弟真不橱才也，欢喜无极！欢喜无极！凡兄所有志而力不能为者，吾弟皆为之可矣。\n\n    信中言兄与诸君子讲学，恐其渐成朋党，所见甚是。然弟尽可放心，兄最怕标榜，常存暗然尚沿之意，断不至有所谓门户自表者也。信中言四弟浮躁不虚心，亦切中四弟之病，四弟当视为良友药石之言，信中又言弟之牢骚，非不人之热中，乃志士之惜阴；读至此，不胜惘然！恨不得生两翅忽飞到家，将老弟劝慰一番，纵谈数日乃快。然向使诸弟已入学，则谣言必谓学院傲惰，众口铄金，何从辨起？所谓塞翁失马，安知非福？科名迟早，实有前定，虽惜阴念切，正不必以虚名紊怀耳。\n\n    来信言《礼记》疏一本半，浩浩茫茫，苦无所得，今已尽弃，不敢复阅，现读〈朱子纲目》，日十余页云云；说到此处，不胜悔恨！恨早岁不曾用功，如今虽欲教弟，譬盲者而欲导入之大途也，求其不误难矣，然兄最好苦思，又得诸益友相质证，于读书之道，有必不可易者数端，穷经必专一经，不可泛骛。读经以研寻义理为本，\n######################\nOutput:"

希庵五月之杪，病势极重，余缄告之云：“治心以广大二字为药，治身以不药二字为药。”并言作梅医道不可恃。希乃断药月余，近日病已痊愈，咳嗽亦止；是二人者，皆不服药之明效大验。季弟信药太过，自信亦太深，故余所虑不在于病，而在于服药，兹谆谆以不服药为戒，望季曲从之，沅力劝之，至要至嘱！\n\n    季弟信中所商六条，皆可允行，回家之期，不如待金陵克复乃去，庶几一劳永逸。如营中难耐久劳，或来安庆闲散十日八日，待火轮船之便，复还金陵本营，亦无不可。若能耐劳耐烦，则在营久熬更好，与弟之名曰贞，字曰恒者，尤相符合。\n\n    其余各条，皆办得到，弟可放心。\n\n    上海四万尚未到，到时当全解沅外。东征局于七月三万之外，又月专解金陵五万，到时亦当全解沅处。东局保案，自可照准，弟保案亦日内赶办。雪琴今日来省，筱泉亦到。（同治元年七月二十日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟季弟\n\n\n\n    沅、季弟左右：\n\n    久不接来信，不知季病全愈否？各营平安否？东征局专解沅饷五万，上海许解四万，至今尚未到皖。阅新闻纸，其中一条言：何根云六月初七正法，读之悚惧惆帐。余去岁腊尾，买鹿茸一架，银百九十两，嫌其太贵。\n\n    今年身体较好，未服补药，亦示吃丸药。兹将此茸送至金陵，沅弟配置后，与季弟分食之。中秋凉后，或可渐服。但偶有伤风微恙，则不宜服。\n\n    余阅历已久，觉有病时，断不可吃药，无病时，可偶服补剂调理，亦不可多。\n\n    吴彤云大病二十日，竟以不药而愈。邓寅皆终身多病，未尝服药一次。季弟病时好服药，且好易方，沅弟服补剂，失之太多。故余切戒之，望弟牢记之。弟营起极早，饭后始天明，甚为喜慰！吾辈仰法家训，惟早起务农疏医远巫四者，尤为切要！（同治元年七月廿五日）\n\n------------\n\n致四弟\n\n\n\n    沅、季弟左右：\n\n    沉霆两军病疫，迄未稍愈，宁国各属，军民死亡相继，遁勤相望。河中积尸生虫，往往缘船而上，河水及井水，皆可不食：其有力者，用舟载水于数百里之外，秽气触人，十病八九，诚宇宙之大劫，军行之奇苦也。\n\n    洪容海投诚后，其党黄朱等目复叛，广德州既得复失，金柱关常有贼窥伺，近闻增至三四万人，深可危虑。余心所悬念者，惟此二处。\n\n    余体气平安，惟不能多说话，稍多则气竭神乏，公事积阁，恐不免于贻误。弟体亦不甚旺，总刨猢静养。莫买田园，莫管公事，吾所嘱者，二语而已。盛时常作衰时想，上场念下场时，富贵人家，不可不牢已二语也。（同治元年闰八月初四日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n    弟读邵尹诗，领得恬淡冲融之趣，此是襟怀长进处。自古圣贤豪杰，文人才士，其志事不同，而其豁达光明之胸，大略相同。以诗言之，必先有豁达光明之识，而后有恬淡冲融之趣；自李白韩退之杜牧之，则豁达处多，陶渊明孟浩然白香山则冲淡处多。杜苏二公，无美不备，而杜之五律最冲淡，苏之七古最豁达，邵尧夫虽非诗之正宗，而豁达冲淡，二者兼全。吾\n######################\nOutput:"

   国藩跪禀\n\n    父母亲大人万福金安。初十日顺天乡试发榜，湖南中三人，长沙周荇农中南元。率五之归，本拟附家心斋处，因率五不愿坐车，故附陈岱云之弟处，同坐粮船。昨岱云自天津归云：“船不甚好。”男颇不放心，幸船上人多，应可无虑。\n\n    诸弟考试后。闻肄业小罗庵巷，不知勤惰若何？此时惟季弟较小，三弟俱年过二十，总以看书为主。我邑惟彭薄墅先生看画略多，自后无一人讲究者，大抵为考试文章所误。殊不知看书与考试，全不相碍，彼不看书者，亦仍不利考如故也。我家诸弟，此时无论考试之利不利，无论文章之工不工，总以看书为急。不然，则年岁日长，科名无成，学问亦无一字可靠，将来求为塾师而不可得。或经或史，或诗集文集，每日总要看二十页。\n\n    今年以来，无日不看书，虽万事业忙，亦不废正业。闻九弟意欲与刘霞仙同读书，霞仙近来见道甚有所得，九弟若去，应有进益，望大人斟酌行之，不敢自主。\n\n    此事在九弟自为定计，若愧奋直前，有破釜沉舟之志，则远游不负。若徒悠忽因愣，则近处尽可度活，何必远行百里外哉？求大人察九弟之志而定计焉，余容续陈。国藩谨禀。（道光二十四年九月十九日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n

四位老弟足下，自七月发信后，未接诸弟信，乡间寄信，较省城寄信百倍之难，故余亦不望。然九弟前信，有意与刘霞仙同伴读书，此意甚佳，霞仙近来读朱子书，大有所见，不知其言话容止，规模气象如何？若果言动有礼，威仪可则，则直以为师可也，岂特友之哉？然与之同居，亦须真能取益乃佳，无徒浮慕虚名；人苟能自立志，则圣贤毫杰，何事不可为？何必借助于人？我欲仁，斯仁至矣。我欲为孔孟，则日夜孜孜，惟孔孟之是学，人谁得而御我哉？若自己不立志，则虽日与尧舜禹汤同住，亦彼自彼，我自我矣，何与于我哉？\n\n    去年温甫欲读书省城，我以为离却家门局促之地，而与省城诸胜己者处，其长进当不可限量，乃两年以来，看书亦不甚多，至于诗文，则绝无长进，是不得归咎于地方之促也。\n\n    去年余为择师丁君叙忠，看以丁君处太远，不能从，余意中遂无他师可从。今年弟自择罗罗山改文，而嗣后沓无消息，是又不得归咎于无良友也。日月逝矣，再过数年，则满三十，不能不趁三十以前，立志猛进也。\n\n    余受父教而余不能教弟成名，此余所深愧者；他人与余交，多有受余益者，而独诸弟不能受受之益，此又余所深恨者也！今寄霞仙信一封，诸弟可抄存信稿而细玩之，此余数年来学思之力，略具大端。六弟前嘱余将所作诗抄录寄回，余往年皆未存稿，近近存稿者，不过百余首耳，实无暇抄写，待明年将全本\n######################\nOutput:"

正月间，俞岱青先生出京，男寄有鹿脯一方，托找彭山屺转寄，俞后托谢吉人转寄，不知到否？又四月托李丙冈寄银寄笔，托曹西垣寄参并交陈季牧处，不知到否，前父亲教男养须之法，男仅留上唇须，不能用水浸透，色黄者多，黑者少，下唇拟待三十六岁始留，男屡接家信，嫌其不详，嗣后更愿详示，男谨禀。（道光二十二年六用初十日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    四位老弟足下：\n\n    九弟行程，计此时可以到家；自任邱发信之后，至今未接到第二封信，不胜悬悬！不知道上有甚艰险否？四弟六弟院试，计此时应有信，而折差久不见来，实深悬望！\n\n    予身体较六弟在京时一样，总以耳鸣为苦；问之吴竹如云：“只有静养一法，非药物所能为力。”而应酬日繁，予又素性浮躁，何能著实静养？疑搬进内城注，可省一半无谓之往还，现在尚未找得。予时时日悔，终未能洗涤自新；九弟归去之后，予定刚日读经，柔日读史之法，读经常懒散不沈著。读《后汉书》，现已丹笔点过八本，虽全不记忆，而较之去年读《前汉书》，领会较深。\n\n    吴竹如近日往来极密，来则作竟日谈，所言皆身心国家大道理。渠言有窦兰泉者，云南人，见道极精当平实，窦亦深知予者，彼此现未拜往。竹如必要予搬进城住，盖城内镜海先生可以师事，倭艮峰先生窦兰泉可以友事，师友夹待，\n######################\nOutput:"

   陈岱云与吾处处痛痒相关，此九弟所知者也，写至此，接得家书，知四弟六弟未得入学，怅怅！然科名有无迟早，总由前定，丝毫不能勉强。吾辈读书，只有两事，一者进德之事，讲求乎诚正修齐之道，以图无忝所生，一者修业之事，操习乎记诵词章之术，以图自卫其身。\n\n    进德之身，难于尽言，至于修业以卫身，吾请言之。卫身莫大如谋食，农工商劳力以求食者也，士劳心以求食者也。故或食禄于朝，教授于乡，或为传食之客，或为入幕之宾，皆须计其所业，足以得食而无愧。科名，食禄之阶也，亦须计吾所业，将来不至尸位素餐，而后得科名而无愧，食之得不得，究通由天作主，予夺由人作主，业之精不精，由我作主。\n\n    然吾未见业果精而终不得食者也，农果力耕，虽有饥馑，必有丰年；商果积货，虽有雍滞，必有通时；士果能精其业，安见其终不得科名哉？即终不得科名，又岂无他途可以求食者哉？然则特患业之不精耳。求业之精，别无他法，曰专而已矣。谚曰：“艺多不养身，谓不专也。”吾掘井多而无泉可饮，不专之咎也！\n\n    诸弟总须力图专业，如九弟志在习字，亦不尽废他业；但每日习安工夫，不可不提起精神，随时随事，皆可触悟。四弟六弟，吾不知其心有专嗜否？若志在穷经，则须专守一经，志在作制义，则须专看一家文稿，志在作古文，则须专看一家文集。作各体诗亦然，作试帖亦然，万不可以兼营并鹜，兼营则必一无所能矣。切嘱切嘱！千万千万！\n\n    此后写信来，诸弟备有专守之业，务须写明，且须详问极言，长篇累�\n######################\nOutput:"

去年树立堂所寄之笔，亦我亲手买者，春光醉目前每支大钱五百文，实不能再寄。汉壁尚可寄，然必须明年会武后，乃有便人回南，春间不能寄也。\n\n    五十读书固好，然不宜以此耽搁自己功课；女子无才便是德，此语不诬也。\n\n    家常欲与我结婚，我所以不愿意者，因闻常世兄最好恃父势，作威福，衣服鲜明，仆从恒赫，恐其家女子有宦家骄奢习气乱我家规，诱我子弟好奢耳。今渫再三要结婚，发甲五八字去，恐渫家是要与我为亲家，非欲与弟为亲家。此语不可不明告之。\n\n    贤弟婚事，我不敢作主，但亲家为人如何？亦须向汪三处查明。若吸鸦片烟，则万不可对。若无此事，则听堂上各大人与弟自主之可也。所谓翰堂秀才者，其父子皆不宜亲近，我曾见过，想衡阳人亦有知之者，若要对亲，或另请媒人亦可。\n\n    六弟九月之信，于自己近来弊病，颇能自知，正好用功自医。而犹曰终日泄泄，此则我所不解者也。\n\n    家中之事，弟不必管，天破了，自有女娲管，洪水大了，自有禹王管。家事有堂上大人管，外事有我管，弟辈则宜自管功课而已，何必问其他哉？至于宗族姻党，无论他与我有隙无隙，在弟辈只宜一要概爱之敬之。孔子曰：“汛爱众，而亲仁。”孟子曰：“爱人不亲，反其仁；礼人不答，反其敬。”此刻未理家事若便多生嫌怨，将来当家立业，岂不个个都是仇人，古来无与宗族、乡党为仇之圣贤，弟辈万不可专责他人也。\n\n    十一月信言：观看《庄子》并《史记》，甚善！但作事必须有恒，不可谓考试在即便将之书丢下，必须从首至尾句句看完。若能明年将《史记》看完，则以后看书不可限量，不必问进学与否也。贤弟论袁诗，论作字，亦皆有所见；然空言无益，须多做诗，多临帖乃可谈耳。譬如人欲进京一步不行，而在家空言进京程途，亦向益哉？即言之津津，人谁得而信之哉？\n\n    九弟之信，所以规劝我者甚切，余览之，不觉毛骨悚然！然我用功，实脚踏实地，不敢一毫欺人，着如此做去，不作外官，将来道德文章必粗有成就，上不敢欺天地祖父，下不敢欺诸弟与儿侄。而省城之闻望日隆，即我亦不知其所自来。我在京师惟恐名浮于实，故不先拜一人，不自诩一言，深以过情之闻为耻耳。\n\n    来书写大场题及榜信，此间九月早已知之，惟县考案首前列及进学之人，则至今不知。诸弟以后写信，于此等小事，及近处戚族家光景，务必一一详载。\n\n    季弟信亦谦虚可爱，然徒谦亦不好，总要努力前进，此全在为兄者倡率之，余他无所取，惟近来日日不恒，可为诸弟倡率。四弟六弟，总不欲以有恒自立，独不泊坏季弟之样子乎？余不尽宣，兄国藩手具。（道光二十四年十二月十八日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n

诸弟在家不听教训，不甚发奋，男观诸来信即已知之。盖诸弟之弟，总不愿在刺的书，自己亥年男在家里，即有此意，牢不可破。六弟欲从男进京，男因散馆去留未定，故此时未许。庚子年接家眷，即请弟等送，意欲弟等京读书也。特以祖父母父母在上，男不敢许，以故但写诸弟而不指定何人。迫九弟来京，其意颇遂，而四弟六弟之惫，尚未遂也。年年株守家园，时有耽搁，大人又不能常在家教之；近地又无良友，考试又不利。兼此数者，怫郁难伸，故四弟六粟不免怨男，其所以怨男者有故。丁酉在家教弟，威克厥爱，甲可怨一矣。云亥在家，未尝教弟一字，可怨二教矣。临进京不肯带六弟，可怨三矣。不为弟择外专，仅延丹阁叔教之，拂厥本意，可怨四矣。明知两弟不厄家居，而屡次信回，劝弟寂守家塾，可怨五矣。\n\n    惟男有可怨者五端，故四弟六弟难免内怀隐衷，前此含意不伸，故从不写信与男，去腊来信甚长，则尽情吐露矣。男接信时，又喜又惧，喜者喜弟志气勃勃，不可遏也。惧者，男再拂弟意，将伤和气矣。兄弟和，虽穷氓不户必兴，兄弟不和，虽世家宦族必败。男深知此理，故禀堂上各位大人，俯从男等兄弟之情实以和睦兄弟为第一。九弟前年欲归，男百般昔留，至去年则不复强留，亦恐拂弟意也。临别时彼此恋恋，情深似海，故男自九弟去后，思之尤切，信之尢深，谓九弟纵不为科目中人，亦当为孝弟中人。兄弟人人如此，可以终身互相依倚，则虽不得禄位，亦伤哉？\n\n    伏读手谕，谓男教弟宜明责之，不宜琐琐告以阅历工夫。\n\n    男自忆边年教弟之信，不下数万字，或明责，或婉劝，或博称，或约指，知无不言，总之尽心竭力而已，男妇孙男女身体皆平安，伏乞放心，男谨禀。（道光二十三年二月十九日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    诸位老弟足下：\n\n

一、西顺兴帐目，丁未年夏起寸至辛亥年夏止，皆有折子，可将折子找出，请一明白人细一遍，究竟用他多少钱，专算本钱，不必兼算利钱，待本钱还清，然后再还利钱，我到武昌时，当写一信与萧沛之三克，待我信到后，然后请寄云伯去厦明可也，总须将本钱利钱，划为两段，乃不至（车葛），六月所借之贡银一百念余金，须设法还他，乃足以服人，此事须与寄云年伯熟计。\n\n

十六日接澄弟初二日信，十八日接澄弟初五日信，敬悉一切。三河败挫之信，初五日固家中尚无确耗，且县城之内，毫无所闻，亦极奇矣。九弟于念二日在湖口发信，至今未再接信，实深悬系，幸接希庵信，言九弟至汉口后有书与渠，且专人至桐城三河访寻下落。余始知沅甫弟安抵汉口，而久无来信，则不解何故？岂余日别有过失，沅弟心不以为然那？当初闻三河凶报，手足急难之际，即有微失，亦当将皖中各事，详细示我。\n\n    今年四月，刘昌储在我家请乩。乩初到，即判曰：“赋得但武修文，得闲字。”字谜败字，余方讶败字不知何指？乩判曰：“为九江言之也，不可喜也。余又讶九江初克，气机正盛，不知何所为而云然？乩又判曰：“为天下，即为曾宅言之。”由今观之，三河之挫，六弟之变，正与不可喜也四字相，岂非数皆前定那？\n\n    然祸福由天主之，善恶由人主之，由天主者，无可如何，只得听之。由人主者，尽得一分算一分，沙得一日算一日。吾兄弟断不可不洗心涤虑，以求力挽家运。\n\n    第一贵兄弟和睦。去年兄弟不知，以至今冬三河之变，嗣后兄弟当以去年为戒，凡吾有过失，澄沅洪三弟各进箴规之言，余必力为惩改。三弟有过，亦当互相箴规而惩改之。\n\n    第二贵体孝道。推祖父母之爱，以爱叔父，推父母之爱。以爱温弟之妻妾儿女，及兰惠二家。又父母坟域，必须改葬，请沅弟作主，澄弟不必过执。\n\n    第三要实行勤俭二字。内间妯娌，不可多讲铺张。后辈诸儿，须走路，不可坐轿骑马。诸女莫太懒，宜学烧茶煮饭；书蔬鱼猪，一家之生气，少睡多做，一人之生气。勤者，生动之气，俭者，收敛之气，有此二字，家运断无不兴之理。余去年在家，未将此二字切实做工夫，至今愧憾，是以谆谆言之。（咸丰八年十一月廿三日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    澄侯沅甫季洪老弟左右：\n\n    十五日接澄沅冬月念九三十两函。得悉叔父、人于二十六日患病，有似中风之象，吾家自道光元年，即处顺境，历三十余年均极平安。自咸丰年来，每遇得意之时，即有失意之事，相随而至。壬子科，余典试江西，请假归省，即闻先大夫人之讣。甲寅冬，余克武汉田家镇；声名多盛。腊月念五甫奉黄马褂之赐，是夜即大败，衣服文卷，荡然无存。六年之冬七年之春，兄弟三人，督师于外，瑞州合围之时，气象甚好，旋即遭先大夫二丧。今年九弟克复吉安，誉望极隆，十月初七，接到知府道衔谕旨，初十即有温弟三可之变。此四事，皆吉凶同域，忧喜并时、殊不可解。\n\n    现在家中尚未妄动，妥慎之至。余之意，则不免皇皇，所寄各处之信，皆言温弟业经殉节矣。究欠妥慎，幸尚未入奏，将来拟俟湖北奏报后，再行具疏也。家中亦俟报到日，乃有举动，诸弟老成之见，贤于我矣。\n\n    叔父大人之病，不知近状如何？兹专法六归送鹿茸一架，即沅弟前次送我者，此物补精血，远胜他药，或者有济。\n\n

四弟九弟信来，言家中大小诸事，皆大人躬亲之，未免过于劳苦。勤俭本持家之道，而人所处之地各不同，大人之身，上奉高堂，下荫儿孙，外为族党乡里所模范，千金之躯，诚宜珍重！且男忝窃卿贰，服役已兼数人，而大人以家务劳苦如是，男实不安于心。此后万望总持大纲，以细微事付之四弟，四弟固谨慎者，必能负荷；而大人与叔父大人惟日侍祖父大人前，相与娱乐，则万幸矣！\n\n

江岷樵有信来，告渠已买得虎骨，七月当亲送我家，以之熬膏：可医痿痹云云，不知果送来否？\n\n    闻叔父去年起公屋，劳心劳力，备极经营。外面极堂皇，工作极坚固，费钱不过百千，而见者拟为三百千模范。焦劳太过，后至吐血，旋又以祖父复病，勤劬弥甚；而父亲亦于奉事祖父之余，撰理家政，刻不少休，侄窃伏思父亲叔父二大人年寿日高，精力日迈，正宜保奏神气，稍稍休息，家中琐细事务，可命四弟管理。至服侍祖父凡劳心细察之事，则父亲叔父躬任之，凡劳力粗重之事，则另添用雇工一人，不够则雇二人。\n\n    侄近年以来，精力日差，偶用心略甚，癣疾即发，夜坐略久，次日即昏倦。晃以力加保养，不甚用功，以求无病无痛，上慰堂上之远怀。外间作文，求写字，求批改诗文者，往往历久而莫偿宿诺，是以时时抱疚，日日无心安神恬之时，前四弟在京，能为我料理一切琐事，六弟则毫不无能管；故四弟归去之后外问之回信，家乡应留心之事，有免疏忽发驰。\n\n

叔父去年四十晋一，侄谨备袍套一付；叔母今年四十大寿，侄谨备棉外套一件，皆交曹西垣管回，服满后即可着。母亲外褂并汉禄布夹袄，亦一同付回。闻母亲近思用一丫环，此亦易办，在省城买，不过三四十千，若有湖北逃荒者来乡，则更为便益，望叔父命四弟留心速买，以供母亲叔母之使令，其价侄即寄回。\n\n    侄今年光景之窘，较甚于往年，然东支西扯，尚可敷衍。若明年能得外差，或升侍郎。便可弥缝。家中今年季弟喜事，不知窘迫否？侄于八月接到俸银。即当寄五十金回，即去年每岁几百金之说也。在京一切张罗，侄自有调停，毫不费力，堂上大人不必挂念，谨禀。（道光二十八年\n######################\nOutput:"

沅弟之字，不可抛荒。温弟哀辞墓志，及王考批妣神道碑之类，余作就后均须沅弟认真书写。宾兴堂记首段未惬，待日内改就，亦须沅弟写之。沅弟虽忧危忙乱之中，不可废习字工夫。亲戚中虽有漱六云仙善书，余因家中碑板，不拟请外人书也。（咸丰九年正月十一日）\n\n------------\n\n致四弟\n\n\n\n    澄侯四弟左右：\n\n    念七日接弟信，欣悉合家平安。沅弟是日申刻到，又得详同一切，敬知叔父临终，毫无抑郁之情，至为慰念！\n\n    余与沅弟论治家之道，一切以星冈公为法。大约有八字诀，其四字即上年所称书蔬鱼猪也。又四字则曰早扫考室。早者，起早也。扫者，扫屋也。考者，祖先祭祀，敬奉显考王考曾祖考，言考而妣可该也。宝者，亲族邻里，时时周旋，贺喜吊丧，问疾济急。\n\n    星冈公常曰：“人待人，无价之宝也。”星冈公生平于此数端，最为认真，故余戏述为八字诀曰：“书蔬鱼猪，早扫考宝也。”此言虽涉谐谑，而疑即写屏上，以祝贤弟夫妇寿辰，使后世子孙，知吾兄弟家教，亦知吾兄弟风趣也，弟以为然否？（咸丰十年闰二月廿九日）\n\n------------\n\n致四弟\n\n\n\n    澄弟左右：\n\n

目下因拔营南渡，诸务丝集。苏州之贼已破，嘉兴淳安之贼，已至绩溪，杭州，徽州，十分危急；江西亦可危之至。余赴江南，先驻徽郡之祁门，内顾江西之饶州，催张凯章速来饶州会合。又札王梅春募三千人扎抚州，保江西即所以保湖南也。又札王人树仍来办营务处，不知七月问可赶到否宁若此次能保全江西两湖，则将来仍可以克复，安危大局，所争只有六七八九数月，泽儿不知已起行来营否？弟为余照料家事，总以俭字为主，情意宜厚，用度宜俭，此居家乡之要诀也。（咸丰十年五月十四日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟季弟\n\n\n\n    季沅弟左右：\n\n    “接信知北岸日内尚未开仗，此问鲍张于十五日获胜，破万安街贼巢，十六日获胜，破休宁东门外二垒，鲍军亦受伤百余人。正在攻剿得手之际，不料十九日未刻，石坟之贼，破羊栈岭而入新岭，桐林岭同时被破，张军前后受敌，全局大震，比之徽州之失，更有甚焉。\n\n    余于十一日亲登羊栈岭，为大雾所述，目无所睹。十二日澄桐林岭，为大雪所阻。今失事恰在此二岭，岂果有天意哉？\n\n    目下张军最可危虑，其次则祁门老营，距贼仅八十里，朝发夕至，毫无庶阻。\n\n    现请求守垒之法，贼来则坚守以待援师，倘有疏虞，则志有素定，断不临难苟免。\n\n    回首生年五十余，除学问未成，尚有遗憾外，余差可免于大戾。贤弟教训后辈子弟，总当以勤苦为体，谦逊为用，以药骄佚之积习，余无他嘱。（咸丰十年十月二十日）\n\n------------\n\n致四弟\n\n\n\n

湘潭带漆，必须多带，此物难辨真假，不可邀人去同买，反有奸弊。在省考试时，与朋友问看漆之法，多问则必能知一二。若临买时，向纸行邀人同去，则必心亏。如不知看漆之法，则今年不必买太多，待明年讲究熟习，再买不迟，今年漆新寿具之时，祖父母寿具，必须加漆。以后每年加漆一次，四具同加，约计每年漆钱多少，写信来京，付至省城甚易，此事万不可从俭，子孙所为报恩之处，惟此最为切产，其余毕竟虚文也。孙意总以厚漆为主，由一层以加至数十层，愈厚愈坚，不必多用瓷灰夏布等物，恐其与漆不相胶粘，历久而脱壳也，然此事孙未尝经历讲究，不知如何而后尽善。家中如何办法，望四弟写信详细告知，更望叔父教训诸弟，经理家事。\n\n    心斋兄去年临行时，言到县即送银廿八两至我家，孙因十叔所代之钱，恐家中年底难办，故向心斋通挪，因渠曾挪过孙的，今渠既未送来，则不必向渠借也。家中目下敷用不缺，此孙所第一放心者，孙在京已借银二百两，此地通挪甚易，故不甚窘迫，恐不能顾家耳。\n\n    曾孙妹妹二人体甚好，四月念三日，已种牛痘，万无一失，系广东京官，设局济活贫家婴儿，不取一钱，兹附回各法一张，敬呈慈览，湘潭长沙皆有牛痘公局，可惜乡间无人知之。\n\n    英夷去年攻占浙江宁波府及定海镇海两县，今年退出宁波，攻占乍浦可痛恨，京城人心，安静如无事时，想不日可殄灭也。孙谨禀。（道光二十十年四月廿七日）\n\n------------\n\n禀祖父母\n\n\n\n

逆夷海氛甚恶，现在江苏滋扰，宝山失守，官兵退缩不前，反在民间骚扰，不知何日，方可荡平。天津防堵甚严，或可无虑，同乡何子贞全家住南京，闻又将进京，谢果堂太守，于六月进京，初意欲捐复，多恐不能，郑莘田放贵州西道，黎樾乔转京畿道，同乡京官，绝少在京。\n\n    孙光景虽艰，而各处通挪，从无窘迫之时，但不能寄货回家，以奉甘旨之需，时深愧惊，前寄书征一表叔，言将代作墓志，刻下实无便可寄，蕙妹移居后，究不知光景如何？孙时为挂念，若有家信来京，里详明书示，孙在京自当谨慎，足以仰慰慈怀，孙谨禀。（道光二十年六月初十日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n

吾于五七古学社韩，五六律学杜，此二家无一字不细看，外此则古诗学苏黄，律诗学义山，此三家，亦无一字不着，五家之外；则用功浅矣，我之门径如此，诸弟或从我行，或别寻门径随人性之所近而为之可耳，余近来事极紊，然无日不着书，今年已批韩诗一部，正月十八批毕，现在批史记三之二，大约四月可批完。诸弟所看书，望详示，邻里有事，京望示知，国藩手草。（道光二十五年三月初五日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n

   孙男国藩跪禀\n\n    祖父大人万福金安。廿九日早，接丹阁十叔信，系正月廿八日发，始知祖父大人于二月问体气违和，三月已痊愈，至今康健如常，家中老幼均吉，不脸欣幸！四弟于五月初九寄信物于彭山屺处，至今尚未到，大约七月可到。丹阁叔信内言：去年楚善叔田业卖于我家承管，其曲折甚多。\n\n    “添梓坪借钱三百四十千，其实只三百千，外四十千，系丹阁叔因我家景况艰窘，勉强代楚善叔解危，将来受累不浅，故所代出之四十千，自去冬至今，不敢向我家明言。不特不敢明告祖父，即父亲叔父之前，渠亦不敢直说。盖事前说出，则事必不成，不成则楚善叔逼迫无路，二伯祖母奉养必阙，而房日见凋败，终无安静之日矣。事后说出，则我家既受其累，又受其欺，祖父大人必怒，渠更无辞可对，无地自容。”故将此事写信告知孙男，托孙原其不得以之故，转禀告祖父大人现在家中艰难，渠所代出之四十千，想无钱可以付渠。\n\n    八月心斋兄南旋，孙在京借银数十两，付回家中，归兹此项，大约须腊底可到，因心斋兄走江南回故也。孙此刻在京，光景渐窘，然当京官者，大半皆东扯西支，从无充裕之时，亦从无冻饿之时，家中不必系怀。孙现今旨长郡会馆事，公项存件，亦已无几。\n\n

   甲三病时，孙妇曾跪许装家中观世音菩萨金身，伏求家中今年酬愿。又言四冲有寿佛祖像，祖母曾叩许装修，亦系为甲三而许，亦求今年酬谢了愿。李霖生身后事，办理颇如意，其子可于七扶梓回南，同乡各官如常。家中若有信来，望将王率五家光景写明，肃此，谨禀。\n\n    祖父母大人万福金安。（道光二十一年六月廿九日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n

祖父母大人万福金安，去年腊月十八，曾寄信到家，言寄家银一千两，以六百为家还债之用，以四百为馈赠亲族之用，其分赠数月，另载寄弟信中，以明不敢自专之义也，后接家人，知兑啸山百三十千，则此银已亏空一百矣，顷闻曾受恬丁艰，其借银恐难遽完，则又亏空一百矣，所存仅八百，而家中旧债尚多，馈赠亲族之银，系孙一人愚见，不知祖父母父亲叔父以为可行否？伏乞裁夺。\n\n    孙所以汲汲馈赠者，盖有二故，一则我家气运太盛，不可不格外小心，以为持盈保泰之道，旧债尽清，则好处太全，恐盈极生亏，留债不清，则好中不足，亦处乐之法也，二则各亲戚家绵贫，而年老者，今不略为资助，则他日不知何如？孙自入都后，如彭满舅曾祖彭五姑母，欧阳岳祖母，江通十舅，已死数人矣，再过数年，则意中所欲馈赠之人，正不知何若矣，家中之债，今虽不还，后尚可还，赠人之举，今若不为，后必悔之！此二者，孙之愚见如此。\n\n    然孙少不更事，未能远谋一切，求祖父叔父作主，孙断不敢擅自专权，其银待欧阳小岑南归，孙寄一大籍衣物，银两概寄渠处，孙认一半车钱，彼时再有信回，孙谨禀。（道光二十四年三月初十日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    六弟九弟左右：\n\n

   至于回洋时有折并南还，则兄实不知，当到家之际，门几如市，诸务繁剧，吾弟可想而知，兄意谓家中接榜后所发一信，则万事可以放心矣，岂尚有悬挂哉？来书辩论详明，兄令不复辩，盖彼此之心虽隔万里，而赤成不啻目见，本无纤毫之疑，何必因二字而多费唇舌？以后来信，万万不必提起可也。\n\n    所寄银两，以四百为馈赠戚族之用，来书云：“非有未经审量之处，即似稍有近名之心。”此二语，推勘人微，兄不能不内省者也，又云：“所识穷乏，得我而为之，抑逆知家中必不可为此慷慨，而姑为是言。”斯二语，毋亦拟阿兄不伦乎？\n\n    兄虽不肖，亦何至鄙且好至于如此之甚？所以为此者，盖族戚中断不可不有一援手之人，而其余则牵连而及。\n\n    兄已亥年至外家，见大舅陶穴而居，种菜而食，为恻然者久之！通十舅送我谓曰：“外熏做外官则阿舅来作烧火夫也。”南五舅送至长沙握手曰：“明年送外熏媳来京。”余曰：“京城苦，舅勿来。”舅曰：“然，然吾终寻汝任所也。”言已泣下，兄念母舅皆已年高，饥寒之况可想，而十舅\n######################\nOutput:"

史尝观《易》之道，察盈虚消息之理，而知人不可无缺陷也，日中则昃，月盈则亏，天有孤虚，地阀东南，未有常全而不阙者，剥也者，复之机也，君子以为可喜也！也者（左女右后），之渐也，君子以为可危也！是故既吉矣川！由吝以趋于凶，既凶矣，则由悔以趋于吉，君子但知有悔耳，悔者，所以守其缺，而不敢求全也，小人则时时求全，全者既得，而吝与凶随之矣，众人常缺，而一人常全，天道屈伸之故，岂若是不公平？\n\n    今吾家椿萱重庆，兄弟无故，京师无比美者，亦可谓至万全者矣。故兄但求缺陷，名所居曰求阙斋，盖求缺于他事，而求全于堂上，此则区区之至愿也，家中旧债：不能悉清，堂上衣服，不能多办，诸弟所需，不能一给，亦求缺陷之义也，内人不明此义，而时时欲置办衣物，兄亦时时教之，今幸未全备；待其全时，则吝与凶随之矣，此最可畏者也！贤弟夫媳诉怨于房闼之间，上是缺陷，吾弟当思所以弥其缺，而不可尽给其求，盖尽给则渐几于全矣。吾弟聪明绝人，将来见道有得，必且韪余之言也。\n\n    至于家中欠债，兄则实有不尽知者，去年二月十六，接父亲正月四日手谕中云：“一切年事，银钱敷用余，上年所借头息钱，均已完清，家中极为顺遂，故不窘迫。”父亲所言如此，兄亦不甚了了，不知所完究系何项？未完尚有何项？兄弟所知者，仅江孝八外祖百两，朱岚暄五十两而已，其余如阳本家之帐，则兄由京寄还，不与家中相干，午冬甲借添梓坪钱五十千，尚不知作何还法？正拟此次禀问祖父。\n\n    此外帐目，兄实不知，下次信来，务望详开一单，使兄得渐次筹划，如弟所云：“家中欠债已传播否？若已传播而实不至，则祖父受吝啬之名，我加一信，亦难免二三其德之诮。”此兄读两弟来书，所为踌躇而无策者也。\n\n    兹特呈堂上一禀，依九弟之言书之，谓朱啸山曾受恬处二百落空，非初意所料，其馈赠之项，听祖父叔父裁夺，或以二百为赠，每人减半亦可，或家中十分窘迫，即不赠亦可，戚族来者，家中即以此信示之，庶不悖于过则归已之义，贤弟观之，以为何如也？若祖父以前信为是，慨然赠之，则此禀不必付归，兄另有安信付去，恐堂上慷慨特赠，反因接吾书而疑沮。\n\n    凡仁心之发，必一鼓作气，尽吾力之所能为，稍有转念，则疑心生，私心亦生，疑心生则计较多而出纳吝矣，私心生则好恶偏而轻重乘矣，使家中慷慨乐与，则慎无以吾书生堂上之转念也。使堂上无转念，则此举也，阿兄发之，堂上成之，无论其为是为非，诸弟置之不论可耳，向使去年得云贵广西等省苦差，并无一钱寄家，家中亦不能责我也。\n\n    九弟来书，楷法佳妙，余爱之不忍释手，起笔收笔皆藏锋，无一笔撤手乱丢，所谓有往皆复也，想与陈季牧井究，彼此各有，卜得，可嘉可喜！然吾所教尔者，尚有二事焉。一日换笔，古人每笔中间，必有一换如绳索然，第一股在上，一换则第二股在上，再换\n######################\nOutput:"

上海派洋船来接少荃一军舟，带银至十八万两之多，可骇而亦可怜！不能不令少荃全军舟行，以顺舆情，三月之内，陆续拔行，其黄昌岐水军，则俟三四月之交，遇大顺风，直冲下去，弟到运漕，可告昌岐来此一晤也。（同治元年三月初三日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n

弟军欲渡，总宜在东梁山以下，采石太平一带，如嫌采石形势太宽，即在太平以上渡江，总宜夺柱关，占内河江面为主，余昨言妙处有四：一曰隔断金陵芜湖之气，二曰水师打通泾县宁国之粮路，三曰芜湖四面被围，四曰抬船过东霸，可达苏州，尤妙之小者耳。\n\n    又有最大者，金柱关可设厘卡，每月进数五六万，东霸可高厘卡，每月亦五六万，二处皆系苏皖交界，弟以本省之藩司，抽本省之厘税，尤为名正言顺，弟应从太平关南渡，毫无疑义，余可代作主张，其迟速则仍由弟作主耳，西梁上下两岸，从三山起，至采石止，望弟绘一图寄来，至要至要！（同治元年四月实六日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n

至于相当大事，全在明强二字，《中庸》学问思辨行五者，其要归于思必明，柔必强。弟向来倔强之气，却不可因位高而顿改。凡事非气不举，非刚不济，即修身齐家，亦须以明强为本，巢县既克，和含必可得手，以后进攻二浦，日弟主持，余相隔太远，不遥制也。《同治二年四月廿七日》\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    诸位老弟足下：\n\n

兹因金竺虔南旋之便，付回五品补服四付，水晶顶二座，阿胶二封，鹿胶二封，母亲耳环一双。竺虔到省时，老弟照单查收。阿胶系毛寄云所赠，最为难得之物，家中须慎重用之。竺虔曾借余银四十两，言定到省即还，其银二十二两为六弟九弟读书省城之资，以四两为买书笔之资，以六两为四弟季弟衡阳从师束修之资，以四两为买漆之费，即每岁漆一次之谓也。以四两为欧阳太岳母奠金，贤弟接到银后，各项照数分用可也。\n\n    此次竺虔到家，大约在五月节后，故一切不详写，待折差来时，另写一详明信付回，大约四月半可到。贤弟在省，如有欠用之物，可写信到京。余不具述。国藩手草。（道光二十三年三月十九日）\n\n------------\n\n禀祖父母\n\n\n\n    孙男国藩跪禀\n\n    祖父母大人万福金安。三月初六日，奉上谕于初十日大考翰�\n######################\nOutput:"

   四位老弟足下：\n\n    初二早，皇上御门办事。余蒙天恩，得升詹事府右春坊右庶子。次日具折谢恩，蒙召见勤政殿天语垂问，共四十余句。是日同升官者，李菡升都察院左副都御史，罗停衍升通政司副使，及余共三人。余蒙祖父金泽，频叨分之荣，此次升官，尤出意外，日夜恐惧修，实无德足以当之。诸弟远隔数千里，必须匡我之不逮，时时寄书现我之过。务使累切积德，不自我一人而呼，则庶几持盈保民，得免带致颠危，诸弟能常进箴规，则弟即吾之良师益友也。诸弟亦宜常存敬畏，勿谓家有人作官，而遂敢于侮人，勿谓已有文学，而遂敢于情才傲人，常存此心，则是载福之道也。\n\n    今年新进士善书甚多，而湖南尤甚，萧史楼既得状元，而周荇农霆昌去岁中南元，孙芝房鼎臣又取朝元，可谓极盛。现在同乡请人，讲求词章之学者固多，讲求性理之学者亦不少，将来省运必不盛。\n\n    余身体平安，惟应酬太繁，目不暇给，自咕月进闱以来，到今已满月，末得看书。内人身体极弱，而无病痛。医者云：“必须服大补，乃可回元。”现在所服之药，与母亲大人十五年前所服之白术黑方略同，差有效验。儿女四人，皆平安顺如常。\n\n    去年寄家之银两，几次写信，求将分给戚族之数目，详实告我，而到今无一字见示，殊不可解。以后务求将帐目开出寄京，以释我之疑，又余所欲问家乡之事甚多，兹另开一单，烦弟一条对，是祷！兄国藩草。（道光二十五年五月初五日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n

男在京平安，男妇服补剂已二十帖，大有效验，医者云；“虚弱之症，能受补则易好。”孙男女及合室下人皆清吉。长沙馆于五月十二日演戏，题名状元南元朝元三匾，同日晓挂，极为热闹，皆男总办，而人人乐从，头门对联云：“同拜十进士，庆榜三各元。”可谓盛矣！\n\n

男得请封章，如今年可用玺，则明春可寄回，如明复用玺，则秋喑寄回。然既得诏旨，则虽诰轴未归，而恩已至矣。望祖父先换顶，其四品补吸取，俟候男在京寄回。可与诰轴并付。湖南各家俱平安，余俟续具，男谨禀。（道光二十五年十月二十九日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n    父母亲大人万福金安。男头上疮癣，至今款愈。近日每天洗两次，夜洗药水，早洗开水，本无大毒，或可因勒洗而好。闻四弟言，家中连年生热毒者八人，并男共九人，恐祖坟有不净处，望时时打扫，但不可妄为动土，致惊幽灵。\n\n    四弟六弟及儿妇孙男女等绵平安。男近与同年会课作赋，每日看书如常，饮食起居如故。四弟课纪泽读，师徒皆有课程。六弟文章极好，似明年纳监下场，但现无银，不知张罗得就否？\n\n    同乡唐镜海先生已告病，明春即将回南，所著《国朝学案》一书，系男约同人，代为发刻，其刻价则系耦庚先生所出。前门内有义塾，每年延师八人，教贫户子弟三百余人。昨首事社姓已死，男约同人接管其事，亦系集腋成裘，男花费亦无几。\n\n    纪泽虽从四弟读书，而李作屋先生尚住男宅，渠颇思南归，但未定计耳。诰封二轴，今年不能用玺，明年及可寄回。萧辛五已寄鹿胶一片，阿胶半斤与他。家中若须阿胶鹿胶，望信来京，从便觅寄。男谨禀。（道光二十五年十一月二十日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n    父母亲大人万福金安。乙巳十一月廿二日，同乡彭棣搂放广西思恩府知府，廿四日陈岱云放江西吉安府知府，岱云年仅三十二岁，而以翰林出为太守，亦的来所见者，人皆代渠庆幸，而渠深以未得主考学政为恨。且近日外官情形，动多掣肘，不如京官清贵安稳，能得外差，固为幸事，即不得差，亦可读书养望，不染尘埃。岱云虽以得郡为荣，仍以失去玉堂为海，自放官后，摒挡月余，已于十二月廿八日出京。是夕，渠有家书到京，男拆开，接大人十一月廿四所示手谕，内叔父及九弟季弟各一信，彭茀庵表叔一信，具悉家中一切事。\n\n    前信言莫管闲事，非恐大人出入衙门；盖以我邑书吏，欺人肥已，党邪嫉正。\n\n    设有公正之乡绅，取彼所鱼肉之善良而扶植之，取被所朋比这狐鼠而锄抑之；则于彼大有不便，必且造作谣言，加我以不美之名，进谗于官，代我遘不解之怨。而官亦阴庇彼辈，外虽以好言待我，实则暗笑之而深斥之，甚且当面嘲讽。且此门一开，则求者踵至，必将目不暇给，不如一切谢绝。今大人手示，亦云杜门谢客，此男所深为庆幸者也！\n\n    男身体平安，热毒至今未好，涂药则稍愈。总不能断根。十二月十二，蒙恩充补日讲起注官。廿二日，又得充文渊阁直阁事。两次恭谢天恩，兹并将原折付回。\n\n    讲官共十八人，满八缺，汉十缺，其职司则皇上所到之处，须轮四人侍立，直闻事四缺，不分满汉，其职司则皇上临御经筵之日，四人皆侍立而已。\n\n    四弟大弟，皆有进境。孙男读书已至陈风，男妇及孙女等皆好。欧阳牧云有信来京，男与商请封及荐馆事，二事男俱不能应允，故作书宛转告\n######################\nOutput:"

父母亲大人万福金安。九月二三四日内，诰轴用玺，大约十八日右领到。同乡夏阶平部丁内艰，二十日起程回南。男因渠是素服，不便托带诰轴，又恐其在道拜客，或者耽搁。祖母大人于月出廿九寿，若赶紧送回，尚可于寿辰迎接连轴。祖母特命四弟束装出京，专送诰轴回家，与夏阶平同伴，计十一月十七八可到汉口。\n\n    汉口到岳州，不过三四天，雇轿五天可到家。四弟到省，即专人回家，以便家中办事，迎接诰命。\n\n    见事难以逆料，风顺则坐船，风不顺则坐轿。恐四弟道上或有风水阻隔，不能赶上祖母寿辰，亦未顺知。家做生日酒，且不必办接诰封事。若四弟能到，廿七日有信，廿八办鼓手香案，廿九接片可也。倘四弟能到省之信，则廿九但办寿筵，明睥正月初八日接片可也。倘四弟不归而托别人，不特廿九赶不上，恐初八亦接不到，此男所以特命四弟送归之意耳。\n\n

男等在京，身体平安，男妇生女后亦平善。六弟决计留京，弟在江西，有信来甚好；陈岱云待之如胞弟，饮食教诲，极为可感！书法亦大有长进，然无故而依人，究似非宜。男写书与九弟，嘱其今年偕郭筠仙同伴回家，大约年底可到家。男在京一切用度，自吸调度，家中不必挂心。男谨禀。（道光二十六年十月廿五日）\n\n------------\n\n禀父母\n\n\n\n    男国藩跪禀\n\n    父母亲大人膝下：昨初九日已刻，接读大人示谕，及诸弟信，藉悉一切。祖父大人之病已渐愈，不胜褥祝，想可由此而痊愈也。男前与朱家信，言无时不思乡土，亦久宦之人所不免，放前此家信亦言之。今既承大人之命，则一意服官，不取违拗，不作是想矣。昨初六日派总裁房差，同乡惟黄恕皆一人。男今年又不得差，则家中气运不致太宣泄，祖父大人之病，必可以速愈，诸弟今年或亦可以入学，此盈虚自然之理也。\n\n

冯树堂就易念园馆，系予所荐，以书启兼教读，每年得百六十余。李竹屋出京后，已来信四封，在保定讷制台赠以三个金，且留乾馆与他；在江苏，陆立夫先生亦荐乾俸馆与他，渠甚感激我。考教习，余为总裁，而同乡寒士如蔡贞斋等，皆不得取，余实抱愧。\n\n    寄回祖父父亲袍褂二付，祖父系夹的，宜好好收拾，每月一看，数月一晒。百岁之后，即以此为敛眼，以其为天恩所赐，其材料外间买不出也。父亲做棉的，则不妨长著，不必为深远之计，盖父亲年未六十，将来或更有君恩赐眼，亦未可知。\n\n    祖母大人葬后，家中诸事顺遂，祖父之病已愈，予之痹症亦愈，且骤升至二品，则风水之好可知，万万不可改葬。若再改葬，则谓之不祥，且大不孝矣。\n\n    然其地于究嫌其面前不甚宽敞，不便立牌坊，起诰封碑亭，亦不便起享堂，立神道碑。予意乃欲求尧阶相一吉地，为祖父大人将来寿台，弟可将此意禀告祖父见允否？盖诰封碑亭，断不可不修，而祖母又不可改葬，将来势不能合葬，乞禀告祖父，总以祖父之意为定。前门长女对袁家，次女对陈家，不知堂上之意如何？现在陈家信来，谓我家一定对第，甚欢喜！余容后具。兄国藩草。（道光二十七年六月十八日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    澄侯温甫子值季洪四位老弟左右：\n\n    正月十日曾寄家信，甚为详备。二月初三接到澄弟十一月二十夜之信，领悉一切。今年大京察，侍郎中休致者二人，德远村冯吾园两先生也，余即补吾国先生之缺。向来三载考绩，外官谓之大计，京官谓之京察。京察分三项，一二品大员及三品之副都御史，皇上皆能记忆其人，不必引见，御笔自下朱谕，以为彰瘅，此一项也。自宗人府丞以下，凡三四五品京官，曾引见，有黜而无陟，前在碾儿胡同时，间墨学士奎光，即引见体致者也，此一项也。自五品而下，如翰林内阁御史大部，由各堂官考差，分别一二三等，一等则放府道，从前如劳辛阶易念园。今年如陈竹伯，皆京察一等也，此一项也。\n\n    余自到礼部，比从前较忙冗，恨不得有人帮办离中琐细事：然以家中祖父之病，父叔勤苦已极，诸弟万无来京之理。且如温甫在京，佟主再三劝诱，令之南归，今岂肯再蹈覆辙，今之北来。江岷樵以拣发立官达浙，岷樵即应允矣。适徐爱渠清星阶教书，星阶立即就徐馆，言定秩间仍往浙依江，江亦应允。\n\n    邹墨林自河南来京，意欲捐教，现寓圆通观，其为人实诚笃君子也。袁漱六新正初旬，忽吐血数天，现已痊愈。黄正斋竟为本部司员，颇难为情。余一切循嫌恭之道，欲破除江平，而黄总不免拘谨。余现尚未换绿呢车，惟添一骡，盖八日一赴园，不能不三牲口也。书不一一。兄国藩草。（道光二十九着二月初六日）\n\n------------\n\n致诸弟\n\n\n\n    澄侯温甫子植季洪四位老弟足下：\n\n

左臂疼痛，不能伸缩，实深悬系，兹专人送膏药三个与弟，即余去年贴手臂而立愈者，可试贴之，有益无损也。拂意之事，接于耳目，不知果指何事？若与阿兄是有不合则尽可不必拂郁；弟有大功于家，有大功于国，余岂有不感激不爱护之理？\n\n    余待希厚雪霆诸君，颇自觉仁让兼至，岂有待弟反薄之理？惟有时与弟意趣不合，弟之志事，颇近春夏发舒之气，余之志事，颇近秋冬收啬之气。弟意以发舒而生机乃旺，余意以收啬而生机乃厚．平日最好昔人花未全开月未圆七字，以为借福之道，保泰之法，莫精于此，曾屡次以此七字教诫春霆，不知与弟道及否？\n\n    星冈公昔年诗人，无论贵贱老小，纯是一团和气。独对子孙诸侄，则严肃异常，遇佳时令节，尤为凛凛不可犯。盖亦具一种收啬之气，不使家中欢乐过节，流于放肆也，余于弟营保举银钱军械等事，每每稍示节制，亦犹本花未全开月末圆之义。至危迫之际，则救焚拯溺，不复稍有所吝矣。弟意有不满处，皆在此等上头，故将余之襟怀揭出，俾弟择其疑而豁其郁，此关一破，则余兄弟丝毫皆合矣。\n\n    再余此次应得一品荫生，已于去年八月咨部，以纪瑞侄承荫；因恐弟辞让，故当时仅告澄而本告弟也。将来瑞侄满二十岁时，纪泽已三十矣。同去考荫，同当部曹，若能考到御史，亦不失世家气象。以弟于祖父兄弟宗族之河，竭力谒诚，将来后辈必有可观。目下小恙，断不为害，但今年切不宜亲自督队耳。（同治二年正月十八日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n    臂疼尚未大愈，至为县念。然治之之法，只宜贴膏药，不宜服水药。余日内当赴金陵看视，正月当成行也尝奉寄谕，知少荃为季弟请二品恤典传，予谥建祠，一一允准，但未接阅谕旨耳。陈栋之勇既好，甚慰甚慰！纪梁宜荫一节，予亦思之再四，以其目未痊愈，读书作字，均难加功。弟且有功于家庭根本之地，不将为同气之冠，亦为各族所罕，质谱祖父在天之灵，亦应如此。\n\n    九伏洲北渡之贼，果有若干？吾意尚以南岸为重；刘南云王峰臣两军，幸勿速调北渡。盖北岸守定安合无庐舒五城，此外均可挽救，南岸若失宁国，则不可救矣。（同治二年正月廿七日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n    弟之谢恩折，尚可由安庆代作写代递，初膺开府重任，心中如有欲说之话，思自献于君父之前者，尽可随时陈奏，奏议是人臣最要之事，弟须加一番工夫。弟文笔不患不说明，但患不简洁，以后从简当二字上著力。（同治二年四月初一日）\n\n------------\n\n致九弟\n\n\n\n    沅弟左右：\n\n    辞谢一事，本可浑浑言之，但未收回成命，已请筱泉子密代弟与余各拟一折矣，昨接弟咨，已换署新街，则不必再行辞谢。吾辈所最宜畏人敬慎者，第一则以方寸为严师，其次则左右近习之人，如巡捕戈什幕府文案，及部下营哨官属，又其次乃畏清议。今业已换称新衔，一切公文体制，为之一变，而又具疏辞官，已知其砂出于至诚矣。\n\n

罗山进攻义宁，闻初四日可止界上，初五六日当可开仗。湖南三面用兵，骆中丞请罗山带兵回湘，业经入奏。如义宁能攻破，恐罗山须回湖南，保全桑梓，则此间又少一劲旅矣。内湖水师，船炮俱精，特少得力营官，现调彭雪琴来江，当有起色。\n\n    盐务充饷，是一大好事，惟浙中官商，多思专利。邵位西来江，会议已有头绪，不知渠回浙后，彼中作事人能\n######################\nOutput:"

接弟信，具悉一切。弟谓命运作主，余所深信，谓自强者，每胜一筹，则余不甚深信。凡国之强，必须多得贤臣；凡家之强，必须多出贤子弟，此亦关乎天命，不尽由于人谋。至一身之强，则不外乎北宫黝、孟施舍、曾子三种，孟子之集议而慊，即曾子之自反而缩也。\\n\\n    惟曾子与孔子告仲田之强，略为可久可常，此外斗智斗力之强，则有因强而大兴，亦有因强而大败。古来如李斯曹操董卓杨素，其智力皆横绝一世，而其祸败亦迥异寻常，近世如陆何萧陈皆予知自雄，而俱不保其终；故吾辈在自修处求强则可，在胜人处求强则不可。若专在胜人处求强，其能强到底与否，尚未可知，即使终身强横安稳，亦君子所不屑道也。\\n\\n    贼匪此次东窜，东军小胜二次，大胜一次，刘潘大胜一次，小胜数次，似已大受惩创，不似上半年之猖撅。但求不窜陕洛，即窜鄂境，或可收夹击之效。\\n\\n    余定于明日请续假一月，十月请开各缺，仍留军营麇量本戳，会办中路剿匪事宜而已。（同治五年九月十二日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致九弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    沅弟左右：\\n\\n    鄂督五福堂有回禄之灾，幸人口无恙，上房无恙，受惊已不小矣。其屋系板壁纸糊，本易招火；凡遇此等事，只可说打杂人役失火，固不可疑会匪之毒谋，尤不可怪仇家之奸细。若大惊小怪，胡想乱猜，生出多少枝叶，仇家转得传播以为快。惟有处处泰然，行所无事，申甫所谓好汉打脱牙和血吞，星冈公所谓有福之人善退财，真处逆境者之良法也。\\n\\n    弟求兄随时训示申儆，名子自问近年得力，惟有一悔字诀。兄昔年自负本领甚大，可屈可伸，可行可藏，又每见得人家不是。自从丁已戊午大悔大悟之后，乃知自己全无本领，凡事都见得人家有几分是处，故自戊午至九载，与四十岁以前泅不相同。大约以能立能达为体，以不怨不尤为用。立者，发奋自强，站得住也。达者，办事圆融，行得通也。\\n\\n    吾九年以来，痛戒无恒之弊，看书写字，从未间断，选将练兵，亦常留心，此皆自强能立工夫。奏疏公牍，再三斟酌，无一过当之语，自夸之辞，此皆圆融能达工夫。至于怨天本有所不敢，尤人则尚不能免，亦皆随时强制而克去之。\\n\\n    弟若欲自儆惕，似可学阿兄丁戊二年之悔，然后痛下针贬，必有大进。立达二字，吾于己未年，曾写于弟之手卷中，弟亦刻刻思自立自强，但于能达处尚欠体验，于不怨尤处，尚难强制。吾信中言皆随时指点，劝弟强制也。赵广汉本汉之贤臣，因星变而劾魏相，后乃身当其灾，可为殷鉴。默存一悔字，无事不可挽回也。\\n\\n

吾尝见朋友不中牢骚太甚者，其后必多抑塞，如吴（木云）台凌荻舟之流，指不胜屈。盖无故而怨天，则天必不许，无故而尤天，则天必不许，无故而尤人，则人必不服，感应之理，自然随之。温弟所处，乃读书人中最顺之境，乃动则怨尤满腹，百不如意，实我之所不解。以后务宜力除此病，以吴（木云）台凌荻舟为眼前之大戒。凡遇牢骚欲发之时，则反躬自思，吾果有何不足，而蓄此不平之气，猛然内省，决然去之。不惟平心谦抑，可以早得科名，亦一养此和气，可以稍减病患。万望温弟再三细想，勿以吾言为老生常谈，不直一哂也。\\n\\n

闻左帅近日亦极谦慎，在汉口气象何如？弟曾闻其大略否？申甫阅历极深，若遇危难之际，与之深谈，渠尚能于恶风骇浪之中，默识把舵之道，在司道中，不可多得也。（同治六年三月初二日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n------------\\n\\n禀父母\\n\\n\\n\\n    男国藩跪禀\\n\\n

兄病体已愈十之七人，日内并未服药，夜间亦能熟睡，至子正以后则醒，是中年后人常态，不足异也。湘阴吴贞阶司马，于念六日来乡，是厚庵嘱其来一省视，次日归去。\\n\\n    余所奏报销大概规模一折，奉朱批该部议奏，户部旋于二月初九日复奏，言曾国藩所拟，尚属妥协云云。至将来需用部费，不下数万，闻杨彭在华阳镇抽厘，每月可得二万，系雪琴督同凌荫廷刘国斌经纪其事，其银归水营杨彭两大股分用。余偶言可从此项下设法筹出部费，贞阶力赞其议，想杨彭亦必允从。此款有着，则余心又少一牵挂矣。\\n\\n    温弟丰神较峻，与兄之伉直简澹，虽微有不同，而其难于谐世，则殊途而同归，余常用为虑。大抵胸中抑郁，怨天尤人，不特不可以涉世，亦非所以养德，不待无以养德，亦非所以保身。中年以后，则肝肾交受其苟，尽郁而不畅则伤木，心火站烁则伤水。科今日之目疾，及夜不成寐，其由来不外乎此。故于两弟时时以平和二字相勖，幸勿视为老生常谈，至嘱至嘱！\\n\\n

贤弟闻我近日在外，尚有错处，不妨写信告我。余派委员伍华瀚在衡州坐探，每二日送信一次；家中若有军情报营，可由衡城交伍转送也。（咸丰九年五月初六日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致九弟四弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    澄侯沅甫两弟左右：\\n\\n

树堂均仙自十月起，每十日作文一首，每日看书十五页，亦极有恒。诸弟试将《朱子纲目》过笔圈点，定以有恒，不过数月，即圈完矣。若看注疏，每经不过数月即完，切勿以家中有事，而间断看书之事，又勿以考试将近，而间断看书之课。虽走路之日，到店亦可看，考试之日，出场亦可看也。兄日夜悬望，独此有恒二字告诸弟，伏愿诸弟刻刻留心。兄国藩手草。（道光二十四年十一月廿一日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

六弟自怨数奇，余亦深以为然；然屈于小试，辄发牢骚，吾窃笑其志之小而所忧之不大也。君子之立志也，有民胞物与之量，有内圣外王之业，而后不忝于父母之所生，不愧为天地之完人。故其为忧也，以不如舜不如周公为忧也，以德不修学不讲为忧也。是故顽民梗化则忧之。蛮夷猾夏则忧之，小人在位，贤人否闭则忧之，匹夫匹妇不被己泽忧之。所谓悲天命而悯人穷，此君子之所忧也。若夫一体之屈伸，一家之饥饱，世俗之荣斥得失，贵贱毁誉，君子固不暇忧及此也。六弟屈于小试，自称数奇，余穷笑其所忧之不大也。\\n\\n    盖人不读书则已，亦既自名曰读书人，则必从事于《大学》。《大学》之纲领有三，明德新民止至善，皆我分内事也。昔卖书不能体贴到身上去，谓此三项，与我身毫不相涉，则读书何用？虽使能文能诗，博雅自诩，亦只算识字之牧猪奴耳，岂不谓之明理有用之人也？朝廷以制艺取士，亦谓其能代圣贤立言，必能明圣贤之理，行圣贤之行，可以居官莅民，整躬率物也。若以明德新民为分外事，则虽能文能诗，而于修己治人之道？关茫然不讲，朝廷用此等人作官，与用牧猪奴作官，何以异哉？\\n\\n    然则既自名为读书人，则《大学》之纲领皆己立身切要之事明矣。其修目有八，自我观之，其致功之处，则仅二者而已，曰格物，曰诚意。格物，致知之事也。诚意，力行之事也。物者何？即所谓本末之物也。身心意知家国天下，皆物也。天地万物，皆物也。日用常行之事，皆物也。格者，即格物而穷其理也。如事亲定省，物也。究其所以当定省之理，即格物也。事兄随行，物也。究其所以当定省之理，即格物也。吾心，物也。究其存心之理，又博究其省察涵养以存心之理，即格物也。吾身，物也。究其敬身之理，又博究其立齐坐尸以敬身之理，即格物也。每日所看之书，句句皆物也。切己体察，穷其理，即格物也。知一句便行一句，此力行之事也。此二者并进，下学在此，上达亦在此。\\n\\n

弟三月之信，所定功课太多，多则必不能专，万万不可。后信言已向陈季牧借《史记》，此不可不看之书；尔既看《史记》，则断不可看他书。功课无一定呆法，但须专耳。余从前教诸弟，常限以功课，近来觉限人以课程，往往强人以所难；苟其不愿，虽日日遵照限程，亦复无益，故近来教弟，但有一专字耳。专字之外，又有数语教弟，兹待将冷金笺写出，弟可贴之座右，时时省览，并抄一付，寄家中三弟。\\n\\n    香海言时文须家《东莱博议》，甚是，弟先须用笔圈点一遍，然后自选几篇读熟，即不读亦可。无论何书，总须从首至尾，通看一遍；不然，乱翻几页，摘抄几篇，而此书之大局精处，茫然不知也，学诗从《中州集》人亦好，然吾意读总集，不如读专集，此事人人意见各殊，嗜好不同，吾之嗜好，于五古则喜读《文逊，于七古则喜读《昌黎集》，于五律则喜读《杜集》，七律亦最喜《杜诗》，而苦不能步趋，故兼读《元遗山集》。\\n\\n    吾作诗最短于七律，他体皆有心得，惜京都无人可与畅语者。弟要学诗，先须看一家集，不要东翻两阅，先须学一体，不可各体同学，盖明一体，则皆明也。凌笛舟最善为诗律，若在省，弟可就之求救。习字临千字文亦可，但须有恒，每日临一百字，万万无间断，则数年必成书家矣，陈季牧多喜谈字，且深思善悟，吾见其寄岱云信，实能知写字之法，可爱可畏！弟可以从切磋，此等发学之友，愈多愈好。\\n\\n    来信要我寄诗回南，余今年身体不甚壮健，不能用心，故作诗绝少；仅作感春诗七古五章，慷慨悲歌，自谓不让陈卧子，而语太激烈，不敢示人。是仅应酬诗数首，了无可观；项作寄贤弟诗二首，弟观之以为何如？京笔现在无便可寄，总在秋间寄回，若无笔写，暂向陈季牧借一技，后日还他可也；国藩手草。\\n\\n    （道光二十三年六月初六日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    澄侯叔淳季洪三弟左右：\\n\\n    五月底连接三月初一，四月十八，两次所发家信。四弟之信，具见真性情，有困心衡虑郁积思通之象。此事断不可求速效，求速效必助长，非徒无益，而又害之。必要日积月累，如愚公之移山，终久必有豁然贯通之侯，愈欲速则愈锢蔽矣，来书往往词不达意，我能深谅其苦。\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\":

希庵五月之杪，病势极重，余缄告之云：“治心以广大二字为药，治身以不药二字为药。”并言作梅医道不可恃。希乃断药月余，近日病已痊愈，咳嗽亦止；是二人者，皆不服药之明效大验。季弟信药太过，自信亦太深，故余所虑不在于病，而在于服药，兹谆谆以不服药为戒，望季曲从之，沅力劝之，至要至嘱！\\n\\n    季弟信中所商六条，皆可允行，回家之期，不如待金陵克复乃去，庶几一劳永逸。如营中难耐久劳，或来安庆闲散十日八日，待火轮船之便，复还金陵本营，亦无不可。若能耐劳耐烦，则在营久熬更好，与弟之名曰贞，字曰恒者，尤相符合。\\n\\n    其余各条，皆办得到，弟可放心。\\n\\n

   衡阳风俗，只有冬学要紧，自五月以后，师弟皆奉行故事而已。同学之人，类皆庸鄙无志者，又最好讪笑人，其笑法不一，总之不离乎轻薄而已。四弟若到衡阳去，必以翰林之弟相笑，薄俗可恶。乡问无朋友，实是第一恨事，不惟无益，且大有损，习俗染人，所谓与鲍鱼处，亦与之俱化也。兄常与九弟道及，谓衡阳不可以读书，涟演不可以读书，为损友大多故也。\\n\\n

   国藩跪禀\\n\\n    父母亲大人万福金安。初十日顺天乡试发榜，湖南中三人，长沙周荇农中南元。率五之归，本拟附家心斋处，因率五不愿坐车，故附陈岱云之弟处，同坐粮船。昨岱云自天津归云：“船不甚好。”男颇不放心，幸船上人多，应可无虑。\\n\\n    诸弟考试后。闻肄业小罗庵巷，不知勤惰若何？此时惟季弟较小，三弟俱年过二十，总以看书为主。我邑惟彭薄墅先生看画略多，自后无一人讲究者，大抵为考试文章所误。殊不知看书与考试，全不相碍，彼不看书者，亦仍不利考如故也。我家诸弟，此时无论考试之利不利，无论文章之工不工，总以看书为急。不然，则年岁日长，科名无成，学问亦无一字可靠，将来求为塾师而不可得。或经或史，或诗集文集，每日总要看二十页。\\n\\n    今年以来，无日不看书，虽万事业忙，亦不废正业。闻九弟意欲与刘霞仙同读书，霞仙近来见道甚有所得，九弟若去，应有进益，望大人斟酌行之，不敢自主。\\n\\n    此事在九弟自为定计，若愧奋直前，有破釜沉舟之志，则远游不负。若徒悠忽因愣，则近处尽可度活，何必远行百里外哉？求大人察九弟之志而定计焉，余容续陈。国藩谨禀。（道光二十四年九月十九日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    四位老弟足下，自七月发信后，未接诸弟信，乡间寄信，较省城寄信百倍之难，故余亦不望。然九弟前信，有意与刘霞仙同伴读书，此意甚佳，霞仙近来读朱子书，大有所见，不知其言话容止，规模气象如何？若果言动有礼，威仪可则，则直以为师可也，岂特友之哉？然与之同居，亦须真能取益乃佳，无徒浮慕虚名；人苟能自立志，则圣贤毫杰，何事不可为？何必借助于人？我欲仁，斯仁至矣。我欲为孔孟，则日夜孜孜，惟孔孟之是学，人谁得而御我哉？若自己不立志，则虽日与尧舜禹汤同住，亦彼自彼，我自我矣，何与于我哉？\\n\\n    去年温甫欲读书省城，我以为离却家门局促之地，而与省城诸胜己者处，其长进当不可限量，乃两年以来，看书亦不甚多，至于诗文，则绝无长进，是不得归咎于地方之促也。\\n\\n    去年余为择师丁君叙忠，看以丁君处太远，不能从，余意中遂无他师可从。今年弟自择罗罗山改文，而嗣后沓无消息，是又不得归咎于无良友也。日月逝矣，再过数年，则满三十，不能不趁三十以前，立志猛进也。\\n\\n    余受父教而余不能教弟成名，此余所深愧者；他人与余交，多有受余益者，而独诸弟不能受受之益，此又余所深恨者也！今寄霞仙信一封，诸弟可抄存信稿而细玩之，此余数年来学思之力，略具大端。六弟前嘱余将所作诗抄录寄回，余往年皆未存稿，近近存稿者，不过百余首耳，实无暇抄写，待明年将全本\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\",

吾见家中后辈，体皆虚弱，读书不甚长进，曾以为学四事勉儿辈：一曰看生书宜求速，不多读则太陋。一曰温旧书宜求熟，不背诵则易忘。一曰习字宜有恒，不善写则如身之无衣，山之无木。一曰作文宜苦思，不善作则如人之哑不能言，马之肢不能行。四者缺一不可，盖阅历一生深知之，深悔之者，今亦望家中诸侄力行之。两弟如以为然，望常以此教诫子侄为要。\\n\\n    兄在外俩月有余，应酬极繁，眩晕脑气等症，幸示复发，脚中亦愈。惟目蒙日甚小便太多，衰老相逼，时势当然，无足怪也。（同治六年十月廿三月）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n------------\\n\\n禀父母\\n\\n\\n\\n    男国藩跪禀\\n\\n

男身体如常，新年应酬太繁，几至日不暇给，媳妇及孙儿女俱平安。正月十五，接到四弟六弟信，四弟欲偕季弟从汪觉庵师游，六弟欲借九弟至省城诚书。男思大人家事日烦，必不能常在家熟照管诸弟，且四弟天分平常，断不可一日无师，读书改诗文，断不可一课耽搁。伏望堂上大人俯从男等之请，即命四弟季弟从觉庵师，其柬修银，男于八月付回，两弟自必加倍发奋矣！\\n\\n    六弟实不羁之才，乡间孤陋寡闻，断不足以启其见识而坚其心志。且少年英锐之气，不可久挫，六弟不得入学，即挫之矣，欲进京而男阻之，再挫之矣。若又不许肆业省城，则毋乃太挫其锐气乎？伏望上大人俯从男等之请，即命六弟九弟下省读书，其费用，男于二月间付银什两，至金竺虔家。\\n\\n

   盖自西汉以至于今，识字之儒，约有三途：曰义理之学，曰考据之学，曰词章之学，各执一途，互相诋毁，兄之私意，以办义理之学最大，义理明则躬行有要，而经济有本。词章之学，亦民以发挥义理者也。考据之学，吾无取焉矣，此三途者，皆从事经史，各有门径，吾以为欲读经史，但当研究义理，则心一而不纷。\\n\\n    是故经则专一经，史则专主义理，此皆守约之道，确乎不可易者也。\\n\\n    若夫经史而外，诸子百家，汗牛充栋，或欲阅之，但当读一人之专集，不当东翻西阅，如读《昌黎集》，则目之所见，耳之所闻，无非昌黎，以为天地间除《昌黎集》而外，更无别书也。此一集未读完，断断不换他集，亦专字诀也。六弟谨记之，读经读史读专集，讲义理之学，此有志者万不可易者也，圣人复起，必从吾言矣。然此亦仅为有大志者言之，若夫为科名之学，则要读四书文，读试律赋，头绪甚多。四弟九弟厚二弟天资较低，必须为名之学，六弟既有大志，虽不科名可也。\\n\\n

兄少时天分不甚低，厥后日与庸鄙者处，全无所闻，窍被茅塞久矣。及乙未到京后，始有志学诗古文，并作字之法，亦苦无良友。近年导一二良友，知有所谓经学者，经济者，有所谓躬行实践者，始知范韩可学而至也，马迁韩愈亦可学而至也，程朱亦可学而至也。概然思尽涤前日之污，以为更生之人，以为父母之肖子，以为诸弟之先导。无如体气本弱，耳鸣不止，稍稍用心，便觉劳顿。每日思念，天既限我以不能昔思，是天不欲成我之学问也，故近日以来，意颇疏散。\\n\\n    来信又言四弟与季弟从游觉庵师，六弟九弟仍来京中，或肄业城南云云。兄欲得老弟共住京中也，其情如孤雁之求曹也。自九弟辛丑秋思归，兄百计挽留，九弟当言之，及至去秋决计南归，兄实无可如何，只得听其自便。若九弟今年复来，则一岁之内，忽去忽来，不恃堂上诸大人不肯，即旁观亦且笑我兄弟轻举妄动。且两弟同来，途费须得八十金，此时实难措办，六弟言能自为什，亦未历甘苦之言耳。\\n\\n

去年树立堂所寄之笔，亦我亲手买者，春光醉目前每支大钱五百文，实不能再寄。汉壁尚可寄，然必须明年会武后，乃有便人回南，春间不能寄也。\\n\\n    五十读书固好，然不宜以此耽搁自己功课；女子无才便是德，此语不诬也。\\n\\n    家常欲与我结婚，我所以不愿意者，因闻常世兄最好恃父势，作威福，衣服鲜明，仆从恒赫，恐其家女子有宦家骄奢习气乱我家规，诱我子弟好奢耳。今渫再三要结婚，发甲五八字去，恐渫家是要与我为亲家，非欲与弟为亲家。此语不可不明告之。\\n\\n    贤弟婚事，我不敢作主，但亲家为人如何？亦须向汪三处查明。若吸鸦片烟，则万不可对。若无此事，则听堂上各大人与弟自主之可也。所谓翰堂秀才者，其父子皆不宜亲近，我曾见过，想衡阳人亦有知之者，若要对亲，或另请媒人亦可。\\n\\n    六弟九月之信，于自己近来弊病，颇能自知，正好用功自医。而犹曰终日泄泄，此则我所不解者也。\\n\\n

父母大人万福金安。二月十六日，接到家信第一号，系新正初三交彭山屺者，敬悉一切。去年十二月十一，祖父大人忽患肠风，赖神戳佑，得以速痊，烈游子闻之，尚转心悸！六弟生女，自是大喜。初八日恭逢寿诞，男不克在家庆祝，心犹依依。\\n\\n    诸弟在家不听教训，不甚发奋，男观诸来信即已知之。盖诸弟之弟，总不愿在刺的书，自己亥年男在家里，即有此意，牢不可破。六弟欲从男进京，男因散馆去留未定，故此时未许。庚子年接家眷，即请弟等送，意欲弟等京读书也。特以祖父母父母在上，男不敢许，以故但写诸弟而不指定何人。迫九弟来京，其意颇遂，而四弟六弟之惫，尚未遂也。年年株守家园，时有耽搁，大人又不能常在家教之；近地又无良友，考试又不利。兼此数者，怫郁难伸，故四弟六粟不免怨男，其所以怨男者有故。丁酉在家教弟，威克厥爱，甲可怨一矣。云亥在家，未尝教弟一字，可怨二教矣。临进京不肯带六弟，可怨三矣。不为弟择外专，仅延丹阁叔教之，拂厥本意，可怨四矣。明知两弟不厄家居，而屡次信回，劝弟寂守家塾，可怨五矣。\\n\\n    惟男有可怨者五端，故四弟六弟难免内怀隐衷，前此含意不伸，故从不写信与男，去腊来信甚长，则尽情吐露矣。男接信时，又喜又惧，喜者喜弟志气勃勃，不可遏也。惧者，男再拂弟意，将伤和气矣。兄弟和，虽穷氓不户必兴，兄弟不和，虽世家宦族必败。男深知此理，故禀堂上各位大人，俯从男等兄弟之情实以和睦兄弟为第一。九弟前年欲归，男百般昔留，至去年则不复强留，亦恐拂弟意也。临别时彼此恋恋，情深似海，故男自九弟去后，思之尤切，信之尢深，谓九弟纵不为科目中人，亦当为孝弟中人。兄弟人人如此，可以终身互相依倚，则虽不得禄位，亦伤哉？\\n\\n    伏读手谕，谓男教弟宜明责之，不宜琐琐告以阅历工夫。\\n\\n    男自忆边年教弟之信，不下数万字，或明责，或婉劝，或博称，或约指，知无不言，总之尽心竭力而已，男妇孙男女身体皆平安，伏乞放心，男谨禀。（道光二十三年二月十九日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    诸位老弟足下：\\n\\n

澄侯子植季洪足下：\\n\\n    正月十一日发一家信，是日子极不闲，又见温甫在外未归，心中懊恼；故仅写信与诸弟，未尝为书禀堂上大人，不知此书近已接到否？\\n\\n    温弟自去岁以来，时存牢骚抑郁之气，太史公所谓居则忽忽若有所亡，出则不知其往者，温甫颇有此象。举业工夫，大为抛荒，闲或思一振奋，而兴致不能鼓舞，余深忧虑，每劝其痛著祖鞭，并心一往。\\n\\n    温弟辄言思得一馆。使身有管束，庶心有维系。余思自为京官，光景尚不十分窘迫，焉有不能养一胞弟，而必与寒士争馆地；向人求荐，实难启口，是以久不为之谋馆。\\n\\n    自去岁秋冬以来，间温弟妇有疾，温弟羁留日久，牢落无偶，而叔父抱孙之念甚切，不能不思温弟南归，且余既官二品，明年顺天主考，亦在可简放之列，恐温弟留京三年，又告回避，念此数者，欲劝温弟南旋，故上次信道及此层，欲诸弟细心斟酌。\\n\\n    不料发信之后，不过数日，温弟即定得黄正斋馆地。现在既已定馆，身有所管束，心有所系属，举业工夫，又可渐渐整理。待今年下半年再看光景，如我或圣眷略好，有明年主考之望，则到四五月，再与温弟商入南闱或北闱行止。如我今年圣眷平常，或别有外放意外之事，则温弟仍留京师，一定观北闱，不必议南旋之说也。坐馆以瞩束身心，自是最好事，然正斋家澄弟所深知者。万一不合，温弟亦难久坐。见可而留，知难而退，但能不得罪东家，好来好去，即无不可耳。\\n\\n    余自去岁以来，日日想归省亲，所以不能者，一则京帐将近一千，归家途费，又须数百，甚难昔办。二则二品归籍，必须具折，折中难于措辞。私心所愿者，得一学差，三年任满，归家省亲，上也。若其不能，或明年得一外省主考，能办途费，后年必归，次也，若二者不能，只望六弟九弟，明年得中一人，后来得一京官，支持门面；余则告养归家，他日再定行止。如三者皆不得，则直待六年之后，至母亲七十之年，余誓具折告养；虽负债累万，归无储栗，亦断断不顾矣。然此实不得已之计，奢能于前三者之中，得其一者，则后年可堂上各大人，乃如天之福也！不审祖宗默佑否？\\n\\n    现在寓中一切平安，癣疾上半身全好！惟腰下尚有纤痕。家门之福，可谓全盛，而余心归省之情，难以自慰，固偶书及，遂备陈之。\\n\\n    毅然伯之项，去年已至余寓，余始觅便寄南，家中可将书封好，即行送去，余不详尽，诸惟心照，兄国藩手草。（道光二十八年正月廿一日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n    澄侯子植季洪三弟左右：\\n\\n

十六日接澄弟初二日信，十八日接澄弟初五日信，敬悉一切。三河败挫之信，初五日固家中尚无确耗，且县城之内，毫无所闻，亦极奇矣。九弟于念二日在湖口发信，至今未再接信，实深悬系，幸接希庵信，言九弟至汉口后有书与渠，且专人至桐城三河访寻下落。余始知沅甫弟安抵汉口，而久无来信，则不解何故？岂余日别有过失，沅弟心不以为然那？当初闻三河凶报，手足急难之际，即有微失，亦当将皖中各事，详细示我。\\n\\n    今年四月，刘昌储在我家请乩。乩初到，即判曰：“赋得但武修文，得闲字。”字谜败字，余方讶败字不知何指？乩判曰：“为九江言之也，不可喜也。余又讶九江初克，气机正盛，不知何所为而云然？乩又判曰：“为天下，即为曾宅言之。”由今观之，三河之挫，六弟之变，正与不可喜也四字相，岂非数皆前定那？\\n\\n    然祸福由天主之，善恶由人主之，由天主者，无可如何，只得听之。由人主者，尽得一分算一分，沙得一日算一日。吾兄弟断不可不洗心涤虑，以求力挽家运。\\n\\n    第一贵兄弟和睦。去年兄弟不知，以至今冬三河之变，嗣后兄弟当以去年为戒，凡吾有过失，澄沅洪三弟各进箴规之言，余必力为惩改。三弟有过，亦当互相箴规而惩改之。\\n\\n    第二贵体孝道。推祖父母之爱，以爱叔父，推父母之爱。以爱温弟之妻妾儿女，及兰惠二家。又父母坟域，必须改葬，请沅弟作主，澄弟不必过执。\\n\\n    第三要实行勤俭二字。内间妯娌，不可多讲铺张。后辈诸儿，须走路，不可坐轿骑马。诸女莫太懒，宜学烧茶煮饭；书蔬鱼猪，一家之生气，少睡多做，一人之生气。勤者，生动之气，俭者，收敛之气，有此二字，家运断无不兴之理。余去年在家，未将此二字切实做工夫，至今愧憾，是以谆谆言之。（咸丰八年十一月廿三日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

   现在家中尚未妄动，妥慎之至。余之意，则不免皇皇，所寄各处之信，皆言温弟业经殉节矣。究欠妥慎，幸尚未入奏，将来拟俟湖北奏报后，再行具疏也。家中亦俟报到日，乃有举动，诸弟老成之见，贤于我矣。\\n\\n    叔父大人之病，不知近状如何？兹专法六归送鹿茸一架，即沅弟前次送我者，此物补精血，远胜他药，或者有济。\\n\\n

四弟九弟信来，言家中大小诸事，皆大人躬亲之，未免过于劳苦。勤俭本持家之道，而人所处之地各不同，大人之身，上奉高堂，下荫儿孙，外为族党乡里所模范，千金之躯，诚宜珍重！且男忝窃卿贰，服役已兼数人，而大人以家务劳苦如是，男实不安于心。此后万望总持大纲，以细微事付之四弟，四弟固谨慎者，必能负荷；而大人与叔父大人惟日侍祖父大人前，相与娱乐，则万幸矣！\\n\\n

侄近年以来，精力日差，偶用心略甚，癣疾即发，夜坐略久，次日即昏倦。晃以力加保养，不甚用功，以求无病无痛，上慰堂上之远怀。外间作文，求写字，求批改诗文者，往往历久而莫偿宿诺，是以时时抱疚，日日无心安神恬之时，前四弟在京，能为我料理一切琐事，六弟则毫不无能管；故四弟归去之后外问之回信，家乡应留心之事，有免疏忽发驰。\\n\\n

叔父去年四十晋一，侄谨备袍套一付；叔母今年四十大寿，侄谨备棉外套一件，皆交曹西垣管回，服满后即可着。母亲外褂并汉禄布夹袄，亦一同付回。闻母亲近思用一丫环，此亦易办，在省城买，不过三四十千，若有湖北逃荒者来乡，则更为便益，望叔父命四弟留心速买，以供母亲叔母之使令，其价侄即寄回。\\n\\n    侄今年光景之窘，较甚于往年，然东支西扯，尚可敷衍。若明年能得外差，或升侍郎。便可弥缝。家中今年季弟喜事，不知窘迫否？侄于八月接到俸银。即当寄五十金回，即去年每岁几百金之说也。在京一切张罗，侄自有调停，毫不费力，堂上大人不必挂念，谨禀。（道光二十八年\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\",

湘潭带漆，必须多带，此物难辨真假，不可邀人去同买，反有奸弊。在省考试时，与朋友问看漆之法，多问则必能知一二。若临买时，向纸行邀人同去，则必心亏。如不知看漆之法，则今年不必买太多，待明年讲究熟习，再买不迟，今年漆新寿具之时，祖父母寿具，必须加漆。以后每年加漆一次，四具同加，约计每年漆钱多少，写信来京，付至省城甚易，此事万不可从俭，子孙所为报恩之处，惟此最为切产，其余毕竟虚文也。孙意总以厚漆为主，由一层以加至数十层，愈厚愈坚，不必多用瓷灰夏布等物，恐其与漆不相胶粘，历久而脱壳也，然此事孙未尝经历讲究，不知如何而后尽善。家中如何办法，望四弟写信详细告知，更望叔父教训诸弟，经理家事。\\n\\n    心斋兄去年临行时，言到县即送银廿八两至我家，孙因十叔所代之钱，恐家中年底难办，故向心斋通挪，因渠曾挪过孙的，今渠既未送来，则不必向渠借也。家中目下敷用不缺，此孙所第一放心者，孙在京已借银二百两，此地通挪甚易，故不甚窘迫，恐不能顾家耳。\\n\\n

逆夷海氛甚恶，现在江苏滋扰，宝山失守，官兵退缩不前，反在民间骚扰，不知何日，方可荡平。天津防堵甚严，或可无虑，同乡何子贞全家住南京，闻又将进京，谢果堂太守，于六月进京，初意欲捐复，多恐不能，郑莘田放贵州西道，黎樾乔转京畿道，同乡京官，绝少在京。\\n\\n    孙光景虽艰，而各处通挪，从无窘迫之时，但不能寄货回家，以奉甘旨之需，时深愧惊，前寄书征一表叔，言将代作墓志，刻下实无便可寄，蕙妹移居后，究不知光景如何？孙时为挂念，若有家信来京，里详明书示，孙在京自当谨慎，足以仰慰慈怀，孙谨禀。（道光二十年六月初十日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n禀父母\\n\\n\\n\\n    男国藩跪禀\\n\\n

   孙男国藩跪禀\\n\\n    祖父大人万福金安。廿九日早，接丹阁十叔信，系正月廿八日发，始知祖父大人于二月问体气违和，三月已痊愈，至今康健如常，家中老幼均吉，不脸欣幸！四弟于五月初九寄信物于彭山屺处，至今尚未到，大约七月可到。丹阁叔信内言：去年楚善叔田业卖于我家承管，其曲折甚多。\\n\\n    “添梓坪借钱三百四十千，其实只三百千，外四十千，系丹阁叔因我家景况艰窘，勉强代楚善叔解危，将来受累不浅，故所代出之四十千，自去冬至今，不敢向我家明言。不特不敢明告祖父，即父亲叔父之前，渠亦不敢直说。盖事前说出，则事必不成，不成则楚善叔逼迫无路，二伯祖母奉养必阙，而房日见凋败，终无安静之日矣。事后说出，则我家既受其累，又受其欺，祖父大人必怒，渠更无辞可对，无地自容。”故将此事写信告知孙男，托孙原其不得以之故，转禀告祖父大人现在家中艰难，渠所代出之四十千，想无钱可以付渠。\\n\\n

男在京身体平安，国荃亦如常，男妇于六月廿三四感冒，服药数帖，痊愈，又服安胎药数帖。纪泽自病愈后，后又服补剂十余帖，辰下体已复原，每日行走欢呼，虽不能言，已无所不知，食粥一大碗，不食零物。仆婢皆如常\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":

此间兵事，凯章在景德镇相持如故，所添调之平江三营，宝勇一营，均已到防，或可隐扎浚川在南康之多城墟，打一胜仗，夺伪印四十三颗，伪旗五百余面，皆帜至建昌，甚为快慰！惟石达开尚在南安一带；悍贼亦多，不知究竟扫荡否？吉中营以后常不离余左右，沅弟尽可放心。\\n\\n    起屋造祠堂，沅弟言外问訾议，沅弟自任之。余则谓外间之訾议不足畏，而乱世之兵变，不可不虑，如江西近岁，凡富贵大屋，无一不焚，可为殷鉴。吾乡僻陋，眼界甚浅，稍有修造，已骇听闻，右太闳丽，则传播招尤，苟为一方首屈一指，则乱世恐难幸免。望弟再斟酌于丰俭之间，妥善行之。\\n\\n    改葬先人之事，将求富求贵之念，消除净尽，但求免水蚁，以妥先灵，史凶煞，以安后嗣而已。若存一丝求富求贵之念，则必为造物鬼神所忌，以吾所见所闻，凡已发之家，未有续灵得大地者。沅弟主持此事，务望将此意拿得稳，把得定，至要至要！\\n\\n    纪泽姻事，以古礼言之，则大祥后可以成婚，以吾乡旧俗言之，则除灵道场后可以成婚。吾困近日贼势尚旺，时事难测，颇有早办之意。纪泽前两禀，请心壶抄奏折，尽可行之。吾每月送修金二两，应抄之奏，不知家中有底稿否？抄一篇，可寄目录来一查，注明月日。\\n\\n    纪泽之字，较之七年二三月间，远不能逮。大约握笔宜高，能握至管顶者为上，握至管顶之下寸许者次之，握至毫以上寸许者，亦尚可习。若握近毫根。则难写好字，亦不久必退，且断不能写好字。吾验之于已身，验之于朋友，皆历历可验。纪泽以后宜握管略高，从低亦须隔毫根寸余，又须用油纸摹帖，较之临帖胜十倍。\\n\\n

史尝观《易》之道，察盈虚消息之理，而知人不可无缺陷也，日中则昃，月盈则亏，天有孤虚，地阀东南，未有常全而不阙者，剥也者，复之机也，君子以为可喜也！也者（左女右后），之渐也，君子以为可危也！是故既吉矣川！由吝以趋于凶，既凶矣，则由悔以趋于吉，君子但知有悔耳，悔者，所以守其缺，而不敢求全也，小人则时时求全，全者既得，而吝与凶随之矣，众人常缺，而一人常全，天道屈伸之故，岂若是不公平？\\n\\n    今吾家椿萱重庆，兄弟无故，京师无比美者，亦可谓至万全者矣。故兄但求缺陷，名所居曰求阙斋，盖求缺于他事，而求全于堂上，此则区区之至愿也，家中旧债：不能悉清，堂上衣服，不能多办，诸弟所需，不能一给，亦求缺陷之义也，内人不明此义，而时时欲置办衣物，兄亦时时教之，今幸未全备；待其全时，则吝与凶随之矣，此最可畏者也！贤弟夫媳诉怨于房闼之间，上是缺陷，吾弟当思所以弥其缺，而不可尽给其求，盖尽给则渐几于全矣。吾弟聪明绝人，将来见道有得，必且韪余之言也。\\n\\n    至于家中欠债，兄则实有不尽知者，去年二月十六，接父亲正月四日手谕中云：“一切年事，银钱敷用余，上年所借头息钱，均已完清，家中极为顺遂，故不窘迫。”父亲所言如此，兄亦不甚了了，不知所完究系何项？未完尚有何项？兄弟所知者，仅江孝八外祖百两，朱岚暄五十两而已，其余如阳本家之帐，则兄由京寄还，不与家中相干，午冬甲借添梓坪钱五十千，尚不知作何还法？正拟此次禀问祖父。\\n\\n    此外帐目，兄实不知，下次信来，务望详开一单，使兄得渐次筹划，如弟所云：“家中欠债已传播否？若已传播而实不至，则祖父受吝啬之名，我加一信，亦难免二三其德之诮。”此兄读两弟来书，所为踌躇而无策者也。\\n\\n    兹特呈堂上一禀，依九弟之言书之，谓朱啸山曾受恬处二百落空，非初意所料，其馈赠之项，听祖父叔父裁夺，或以二百为赠，每人减半亦可，或家中十分窘迫，即不赠亦可，戚族来者，家中即以此信示之，庶不悖于过则归已之义，贤弟观之，以为何如也？若祖父以前信为是，慨然赠之，则此禀不必付归，兄另有安信付去，恐堂上慷慨特赠，反因接吾书而疑沮。\\n\\n    凡仁心之发，必一鼓作气，尽吾力之所能为，稍有转念，则疑心生，私心亦生，疑心生则计较多而出纳吝矣，私心生则好恶偏而轻重乘矣，使家中慷慨乐与，则慎无以吾书生堂上之转念也。使堂上无转念，则此举也，阿兄发之，堂上成之，无论其为是为非，诸弟置之不论可耳，向使去年得云贵广西等省苦差，并无一钱寄家，家中亦不能责我也。\\n\\n    九弟来书，楷法佳妙，余爱之不忍释手，起笔收笔皆藏锋，无一笔撤手乱丢，所谓有往皆复也，想与陈季牧井究，彼此各有，卜得，可嘉可喜！然吾所教尔者，尚有二事焉。一日换笔，古人每笔中间，必有一换如绳索然，第一股在上，一换则第二股在上，再换\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":

冯树堂就易念园馆，系予所荐，以书启兼教读，每年得百六十余。李竹屋出京后，已来信四封，在保定讷制台赠以三个金，且留乾馆与他；在江苏，陆立夫先生亦荐乾俸馆与他，渠甚感激我。考教习，余为总裁，而同乡寒士如蔡贞斋等，皆不得取，余实抱愧。\\n\\n    寄回祖父父亲袍褂二付，祖父系夹的，宜好好收拾，每月一看，数月一晒。百岁之后，即以此为敛眼，以其为天恩所赐，其材料外间买不出也。父亲做棉的，则不妨长著，不必为深远之计，盖父亲年未六十，将来或更有君恩赐眼，亦未可知。\\n\\n    祖母大人葬后，家中诸事顺遂，祖父之病已愈，予之痹症亦愈，且骤升至二品，则风水之好可知，万万不可改葬。若再改葬，则谓之不祥，且大不孝矣。\\n\\n    然其地于究嫌其面前不甚宽敞，不便立牌坊，起诰封碑亭，亦不便起享堂，立神道碑。予意乃欲求尧阶相一吉地，为祖父大人将来寿台，弟可将此意禀告祖父见允否？盖诰封碑亭，断不可不修，而祖母又不可改葬，将来势不能合葬，乞禀告祖父，总以祖父之意为定。前门长女对袁家，次女对陈家，不知堂上之意如何？现在陈家信来，谓我家一定对第，甚欢喜！余容后具。兄国藩草。（道光二十七年六月十八日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

邹墨林自河南来京，意欲捐教，现寓圆通观，其为人实诚笃君子也。袁漱六新正初旬，忽吐血数天，现已痊愈。黄正斋竟为本部司员，颇难为情。余一切循嫌恭之道，欲破除江平，而黄总不免拘谨。余现尚未换绿呢车，惟添一骡，盖八日一赴园，不能不三牲口也。书不一一。兄国藩草。（道光二十九着二月初六日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

次青之事，弟所进箴规，极是极是，吾过矣！吾过矣！吾因郑魁士享当世大名，去年袁翁两处，及京师台谏，尚细疏保郑为名将，以为不妨与李并举，又有郑罪重，李情轻，暨王锐意招之等语，以为比前折略轻，逮拜折之名，通首读来，实使次青难堪，今弟指出，余益觉大负次青，愧悔无地！余生平于朋友中，负人甚少，惟负次青实甚，两弟为我设法，有可挽回之处，余不惮改过也。（同治元年六月初三日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n------------\\n\\n禀祖父母\\n\\n\\n\\n

吾现已定计于明年八月，乞假归省，后年二月还京，专待家中回信，详明见示。今年父亲六十大寿，吾意不克在家叩祝，悚疚之至！十月四日，奉旨派作较射大臣；顺天武闱乡试，于初五六马箭，初七日步箭，初九十技勇，十一发榜，十二复命。此八日皆八武闱，不克回寓，父亲寿辰，并不能如往年办面席以宴客也。然予既定计明年还家庆寿，刚今年在京，即不称必觞，犹与吾多重逢一不王晋十之例相合。\\n\\n    家中分赠亲族之钱，吾恐银到太迟，难于换钱，故前次为书寄德六七叔祖，并办百折裙送叔曾祖母．现在廷芳宇尚起行，大约年底乃可到湖南；若曾希六陈体无二家，必待照到，乃送钱来，则我家今年窘矣。\\n\\n    二家捐项，我在京其去京平足纹二百四十一两大钱，若合南中漕平，则当二百三十六两五线。渠送钱若略少几千，我家不必与之争，盖丁酉之冬，非来煤垄，则万不能进京也。明年春同，应寄家用之钱，乞暂以曾院捐项用之，我上半年只能寄鹿茸，下半年乃再寄银耳。《皇治经解》一书，不知取回否？若未取回，可令人去取；盖此等书，诸清弟略一涉猎，即扩见识，不宜较以赠人也。\\n\\n    明年小考，须进十干，大场又须送十千；此等钱家中有人分领、使是一家之祥瑞．但澄弟须于在省城时，张罗此项，付各考者，乃为及时．京宫大小平安。纪泽儿已病两月，近日痊愈，今日已上书馆矣。纪鸿儿极结实，声音洪亮异常。仆婢辈皆守旧，同乡各家，亦皆无恙。邹墨林尚在我家，张雨农闱艺甚佳，而不得售，近又已作文数首，其更可畏爱也！书不详尽，写此毕，即赴武闱，十二始归寓。余俟后报。国藩手草。（道光二十九年十月初四日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致诸弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

自七月以来，否得闻家中事，有数件可为欣慰者：温弟妻妾，皆有梦熊之兆，足慰祖父母于九泉，一也。家中妇女，大小皆纺纱科布，闻已成六七机，诸子侄读书尚不懒惰，内外各有职业，二也。阖境丰收，远近无警，此间兵事平顺，足安堂上老人之心，三也，今又闻沅弟喜音，意吾家高曾以来，积泽甚长，后人食报，更当绵绵不荆吾兄弟年富力强，尤宜时时内省，处处反躬自责，勤俭忠厚。以承先而启后，互相勉励可也。\\n\\n    内湖水师，久未开仗，日日操练，夜在防守，颇为认真。周凤山统领九江陆军，亦尚平安。李次青带平江勇三千在苏垣渡，去湖口县十里，颇得该处士民欢心。茶陵州土匪，闻审扰江西之莲花厅，永新县境内，吉安人心震动。顷已调平江勇六百五十人前往剿办，又派水师千人往吉防堵，河道或可保全。\\n\\n    余癣疾迄未愈，幸精神尚可支持。王如一等来，二十四日始到，余怒其太迟，令其即归，发途费九百六十文，家中不必加补，以为懒惰者戒，宽十在营住一个月，打发银六两，途资四千。罗山于十四日克复崇阳后，尚无信来，罗研山兄于今日到营。纪泽纪梁登九峰山诗，文气俱顺，且无猥琐之气，将来或皆可冀有成立也，余不一一。（咸丰五年九月三日书于屏风水营）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致九弟\\n\\n\\n\\n

余生平之失，在志大而才疏，有实心而乏实力，坐是百无一成。李去麟之长短，亦颇与我相似，如将赴湖北，可失至余家一叙再往。润公近颇综核名实，恐亦未必投洽无间也。\\n\\n    近日身体略好，惟回思历年在外办事，愆咎甚多，内省增咎。饮食起居，一切如常，无穷廑念。今年若能为母亲大人另觅一善地，教子便略有长进，则此右豁然畅适矣。弟年纪较轻，精力略胜于我，此际正宜提起全力，早夜整刷，昔贤谓宜用猛火煮，慢火温，弟今正用猛火之时也。\\n\\n    李次青之才，实不可及，吾在外数年，独觉惭对此人，弟可与之常通书信，一则稍表余之歉忧，一则凡事可以请益。余京中书籍，承漱六专人取出，带至江苏松江府署中，此后或易报回。书虽不可不看，弟此时以营务为重，则不宜常看书。凡人为一事，以专而精，以纷而散。荀子称“耳不两听而聪，目不两视而明”，庄子称“用志不纷，乃凝于神。”皆至言也！（咸丰八年正月十一日）\\n\\n------------\\n\\n致九弟\\n\\n\\n\\n
